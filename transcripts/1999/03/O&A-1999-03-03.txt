 1027 WNEW the Rock of New York David Bowie Ziggy Stardust it's Opie and Anthony good afternoon  Hey, we are ready to rock and roll once again today  Is it raining yet? Let me look what happened to our weather today. Well, it was a perfect spring day and now  Looks like it's gonna be a nasty drive home tonight. Yeah, it was pretty nice earlier  mid-50s Opie  Spring around the corner you can just feel it. Thank you. We got off so easy this year  I think we'll get dumped with one more. I think we'll get one more blast 
[00:30]
 Yeah, don't don't think we're totally off the hook. You know those  March blizzards or something kind of like Monica getting one more blast before yeah, no Clinton left  Great sake I'll bite. Thank you. I can't wait till this is over  I cannot wait till this is over. Well, I guess you got to watch, you know, it's annoying the hell out of me though 
[01:00]
 Again, the view this morning the view  Barbara Walters there all of her little kiss-ass cronies star  Jones and the other one and Joy Bay are they're all just lapping her butt about this and Monica interview and she's all oh  Please please don't  Don't I don't want to hype this don't want to hype it  You've been hyping it on every single so the view has been one big month-long infomercial for this interview  Yeah, and she's hyping it. Mm-hmm and and oh it's getting like who cares so they showed a clip finally this morning 
[01:30]
 So I get to say finally she speaks they prettied her up. They gussied her up pretty good  Yeah, if you're into a little bit of a chick, you know with the little baby got back  You know  She's not too bad her face kind of pretty where they make you made her up. Yeah, she um  Quite frankly as the whitest teeth I've ever come across  She does she has wonderful teeth  Um 
[02:00]
 Yeah, yeah, sorry so she's all gussied up and then I don't know  It's very distracting to watch her talk because all you're watching are her lips  Yeah, her lips the way they're moving around the teeth and and she's got the red lipstick on and she does something weird 
[02:30]
 She's got like one of those little those little twisty mouth moves that she does  You know how like Alicia Silverstone has like that little mouth thing. She does. Yes, so she's got her own little mouth thing  So you just watching one? Yeah  Yeah, you're a dirty girl. She said that too in the clip. What'd she say?  She's they play the clip of Bill Clinton saying I did indeed have sex with Monica  Blah blah blah as Monica's watching with Barbara gone, please cry cry you bitch  You know, she's just hoping she cries. I well, I'm sure she cries at least once or twice during these two hours 
[03:00]
 So she's watching that clip and then Barbara goes Monica. How did you feel?  When he said that she goes I felt used I felt like a dirty girl  Yeah, you know why you felt like that Monica cuz you are a dirty girl. You're a dirty little twisty mouth girl  Yeah, you use those lips. Don't you you're dirty  Filthy little girl with your cigar  Yeah, you're a humidor crotch aren't you? Yes, you are 
[03:30]
 And I would do they address that issue. No Barbara tiptoe around the cigar issue  I think she did tiptoe around the cigar issue and she says how she talks about the dress in this and why her mother hadn't  But it's all stuff she makes it sound like she is billing this as the interview of the century  Mm-hmm. Yes century not gonna find out much new information tonight  No, pretty much everything Monica says tonight has been said 
[04:00]
 I guess the interview of Jonas Salk and his cure for polio  Wasn't that important? This is the interview of the century of the century, you know any interview with  A Truman maybe on his decision to drop an atomic bomb  Dad nothing nothing compared to Monica. This chick gave a prez the Hummer. Yeah, it's just it's all hype  It's all bull and I don't think we're gonna see or hear anything new. This has been hashed a thousand times 
[04:30]
 Well, I think later on in the show we're gonna have a little insight into  Other people interviewing Monica Anthony. Oh, yes, I would have loved to seen  I don't know Andrew Dice Clay interview right Monica. Yeah, or maybe Tom Brokaw  Good good or maybe William Shatner interviewing Monica Lewinsky. I wonder if we could get any kind of clips of that  Well, I think we we got some available and we're gonna play those throughout the show go figure maybe Yoshi maybe Yoshi 
[05:00]
 How would that sound if Yoshi was interviewing Monica Lewinsky? How would I know?  Oh, well if you stick around we're gonna let people know how that would sound. Hmm. All right  Okay, okay also on the way because we're just gonna get it out of the way early today  The Reverend Al song is minutes away. He's been arrested. Yeah, I heard yes  He's a demonstrating down on Wall Street. Mm-hmm, and he has been arrested  He even said he was gonna get arrested he went down with the purpose of getting arrested for his little sit-in is it  It's true that they were doing a sit-in. Yeah, he didn't leave much space for his protesters 
[05:30]
 And big Reverend Al has a  Crater mark on the sidewalk  So we'll get the Reverend Al song out of the way, yeah also on the way we got Judas Priest some Kansas Eve six  One oh two seven W any W the Rock of New York with the Allman Brothers midnight writer. Those guys will be at the beacon  Pretty much for the entire  Month of March, you know, look at all those dates and incredible like 20 dates 
[06:00]
 There's a there's still tickets available for a lot of the shows if you're still interested in going to see the almonds at the beacon theater  Yeah, I'll be there tomorrow night. I never miss the Allman Brothers when they come to town. Oh, no  Oh, no, there's a necessity  Sophie and Anthony. Hello. All right. Well tonight's a big a big night for Barbara Walters  I know a lot of people are sick of hearing about Monica. Trust me. So are we yeah, but 
[06:30]
 We think that Monica picked the wrong person to interview her. Yeah, what do we want the cushy little Barbara Walters interview?  She's been kissing her ass on the view too saying that uh, she's such a sweet girl  And you know, she's a victim and all that all that happy horse crap  You think Barbara's gonna ask Monica if you were a tree what kind of tree would you be?  I'll still do the same thing  She doesn't all the interviews get her to cry a couple of them and what is the over-under for crying tonight?  Oh my god, forget about it first five minutes 
[07:00]
 I'm thinking Monica cries four different times in two hours four times in two hours  First one being within the first five minutes within the first five. Yeah. All right, you know, and honestly, I think it's gonna be pretty boring  TV tonight. Yeah, you know exactly what to expect when Barbara Walters interviews someone of high profile  Status like Monica Lewinsky right? No surprises. No surprises and we have come up with a list of people we wish  Would have interviewed Monica. Yeah, we have a couple of people in mind. Sure. It would have made that much more riveting TV 
[07:30]
 Yes, for example Anthony  Andrew Dice Clay now that would be an interview  Could you imagine if Andrew Dice Clay interviewed Monica tonight instead of Barbara Walters? I watched that  I'm just trying to think what that would sound like  Alright, I'd like to welcome this whale to my show, huh? And you know, you're a whale cuz I could see your blowhole. Yay 
[08:00]
 So you're sucking Clinton's right? Does he blow his  On that chubby face of yours, but does he pull out and all over your big time?  Come on answer the question answer the question you whore answer the question  Question look look now she's gonna cry get up Barbara Walters  You're gonna cry. Yeah, you'll look at her a little bit answer the question. What's your mouth full?  You're fucking whore. Look at his big. I don't want you on my show 
[08:30]
 Now two hours of that I was I would lie I was gonna watch that without a doubt  You know, that's an in-depth interview a probing interview by the Dice man and we have a list of other people  Yeah, that's that's dice interviewing Monica. Uh-huh, but there's others  Sure, when you sit at home tonight Anthony and and enjoy maybe Yoshi interviewing Monica just fumbling over the language would be fun 
[09:00]
 I think I mean Yoshi. What would that sound like interviewing Monica?  Monica Ruinsky you are very dishonored  Did you write a Clinton play and I want to know did he poke you?  That too I would like that would be riveting TV I would tune into the Yoshi interview  Yeah, of course. I was instead we're stuck with Barbara Walters tonight. Yeah, do we have another one? 
[09:30]
 How about I don't know Tom Brokaw? Well, if you want to stick with the news-oriented person  Maybe you don't want to go out on a limb with dice or something. Yeah, maybe dice is a little harsh  Tom Brokaw, Mr. Marblemouth himself. I would watch that maybe so you'd sit home and listen that right? Yeah  No, I wonder what that would sound like  Tom Brokaw embassy nightly news where here was Monica  Monica  Monica we're here with Monica 
[10:00]
 We'll be right back after these words  I  Just trying stumbling over her name. I would watch that I'd watch that compelling  Captivating television, unfortunately, he would only get one question out. Yeah, I know enjoyable anything with an elf  It would definitely you know spice up the interview of course, but we're stuck with Babs. Yeah, we got Babs tonight  I think we have a list of others. Yeah. Yeah a couple more like maybe William Shatner  What would that sound like I would love that, you know? All right 
[10:30]
 Maybe later. Yeah later. We'll have a couple more. Yeah later. We'll explore that some other options  One oh two seven WNEW the rock of New York the latest from Tom Petty  That's the song free girl now off his CD echo and that will be in stores  April 13th. Good afternoon. It's Opie and Anthony. Thank you. Well  You know how I think Fox is probably the the best network on TV these days  Well as far as their sensational programming goes, you know 
[11:00]
 Well, I like their their video shows with the cops chasing people and caught on tape. Yeah, and yeah all that stuff  Yeah, now we have known to love you. They're very sensational over there. Well, I think Fox has dropped down a couple notches on my  On my list here. You didn't like the hidden secrets of the Egyptian tombs, but let's face it  That was pathetic  You didn't like Indiana Povich no absolutely pathetic last night we're going down into the Queen's Chamber 
[11:30]
 I hope there aren't any asps down here. I hate snakes  Come on, Indiana Povich. Did you see that guy with him? Yeah, I saw him  He had the Indiana Jones hat on and and the jacket  Yeah, and he's squeaking through it seems set up to me. Of course it was set up  I saw the last hour and a half. Yeah, and remember, you know the scene where they finally let Maury go down into that little tunnel  Yeah, lower me down. Oh, and he's just bitching the whole way down. Yeah. Well, it's getting very skinny down here 
[12:00]
 Oh, oh watch it up with that cheesy camera. Yeah, so they get down and they got out what?  What's the term they use a sarcophagus? That's right a sarcophagus. Look we have found a sarcophagus Indy  Indiana Povich look at what we found. So how convenient that the damn thing, you know just opened up right there  It opened up like one of those transformer toys. Yeah. Yeah, I think like or this  Sarcophagus has not been touched for five thousand years. Yeah. All right. Let's start with destroying it 
[12:30]
 Like they're pulling the side open and it just fell right open fell open  Conveniently right where the camera angle was and there you saw a mummy  Yeah, a mummy that's been lying there for what 4600 years  It's a mummy and and the guy is saying this one obviously from the first  Kingdom for 4,500 years a thousand years ago. It's like wait a minute. How do you know?  How do you know you've only been looking at it for five seconds? How do I know he's even an archaeologist? 
[13:00]
 He's there with that stupid paintbrush brushing everything and his Indiana Jones hat and he was he goes up to this little pile of sand  Next to the sarcophagus and he starts brushing the pile of sand. Yeah, he goes  It pulls out this pot and it's like  Even know the brush there  It was so set up they buried it over and he's like  Yeah, they think they couldn't take the chance that they would have the whole al Capone thing happen again 
[13:30]
 No, so they had to make sure that there was gonna be some kind of payoff  This could be the oldest mummy ever found in its original resting place that was like their big find  Yeah, and then they had the the chick that went down into the Queen's chamber the check  Yeah, I think that lesbian enjoyed going down in the Queen's chamber. We're going to squeeze into the Queen's hold  Right here to tight fit. Yes. Yeah, I like that. She was enjoying that  She's just desecrating a grave site at one point 
[14:00]
 In the grave  Hundred years and she's trotting upon it. Yeah, but I just like Maury walking in the sphincter  I mean the snakes the secrets of the sphincter  Where's short round and it was it was just a waste of time the artifacts they found they found a couple beer mugs 
[14:30]
 Yeah, that's what it was ancient beer mugs that they had. Yeah, it was pretty sad. Hi any W  Hey, I wanted to tell you, you know last night when they were brushing away those pots. Yeah  The the tour guide guy he goes those for the afterlife their beer mugs  Yeah, and povich is just like and that's how I wish the afterlife was  He was wishing he had beer for that show  Realizing it was going nowhere. It's going nowhere fast. They had all that stuff about Mars how we're Martians 
[15:00]
 Yeah, yeah, we could be from Mars  That's it. There's faces on Mars. There's something that looks exactly like the sphincter on Mars  Look at the face  It was ridiculous. All right, man  Thanks, but it wasn't as exciting as Indiana Jones. There were no Nazis in it  No, no chases no explosions that would have been cool if like they started shooting arrows at Maury as he's going down into the tunnel  Yeah, like all right. I have to spell out 
[15:30]
 Connie on the floor if I don't walk on the letters that spell Connie it all collapses  Oh, no in ancient China Connie spell with a K  Look out to the other party  I got my way  Hi, any W. Yeah. Hi, what's up? Yeah, I was wondering if you guys saw last night when they went into that new room  And there was a camera already in the new room  Egyptian camera yeah, you picked you picked up on that, huh? Yeah 
[16:00]
 Get into that new room with the camera already in that room. Yeah the  Egyptian magician or whatever you want to call that guy  Yeah, he's like no one has been been behind this wall in 4200 years and they show him sliding into the room and the cameras already  Look how technologically advanced they want they had video cameras. I'm so glad you picked up on that  You guys are great  Thank you, man. Okay, right and 
[16:30]
 Unfortunately yesterday we predicted that  More he was gonna find Connie's  ovaries  Yeah, one of the terms and it mummified mummified and it that didn't come to pass. I bet he was disappointed you think yeah  Alright, Indiana Povich uncovers nothing. It was just a waste. Yeah, you know a mummy, but that would make a great video game  I was thinking yeah every time they were walking through these little tunnels. I'm just thinking that's a good half-life level  I could play on that level  Like they went into the last tomb that they went in where there was kind of a moat around it and it had some water 
[17:00]
 They had a pump water out of it wasn't that the the king of the underworld is here's the king of the underwater world  I don't know what the hell it was. I think it's another hole. It was probably done in Hollywood the whole thing  Knows but I'm standing in front of a blue screen a pyramid. Yeah, it's a pyramid  But I'm just thinking yeah, I make a great level I could hide back there with the crossbow. I  Don't know I would have liked if a big rock was released big round a boulder running after 
[17:30]
 Yeah, Maury, and he had to like run away and catch up to hang on the wing of a biplane as he's  Trying to flee Belloc who just got the good  I'll get you Belloc  Dr. Povich what was once yours is again mine  I  Machete wielding guy after him and then the dyke at the end of the show starts like crying  She thought is the most incredible thing she's ever been through. I was very touching. I think she's been in many chambers 
[18:00]
 Yeah, something about the pyramid shape reminded her of something. I think upside down bushy  All right, it's a stretch  Wow, geez, all right. She's used to going into  Mobile communication store or call 1-800-255 Bell a cell phone is only as good as the network  It's on choose Bell Atlantic mobile new activation and annual agreement required early termination fee certain other charges and restrictions apply 
[18:30]
 Wow, we're taking a lot of heat over our Maury  Commentary a couple of people thought it was very educational the show's education was boring as hell. They didn't find anything  Yeah, it wasn't like Indiana Jones  Nazis we wanted to see like pygmies chasing Maury with blow darts  I  Wanted to  Get another one I'm getting woozy  Keep running keep running  Indiana and I saw a label on the bottom of that pot of the pottery that the 
[19:00]
 Egyptian magician that dug out of the sand man  Did you see a label on the bottom? Yeah, here one or something  Is that fear one important something like that?  Come on  Yeah, he was the same one like he just kept taking from same of the chairman  All right, would we off the air very it again. I have my trusty  Archaeology paintbrush  That's all the tools he needed was a paintbrush a brush and did you see at one point?  He gave Maury the paintbrush to brush off the mummy. Yeah, he's like, I don't want to touch it with my hand 
[19:30]
 He goes here who's this and then Maury drops the paintbrush the handle hits the mummy  So he picks it up. So now by proxy he's touching the mummy and then he just kind of  Just like get this half-hearted little brush. No, it proves that they they already saw those sites  You're going down in this tunnel for the first time and you want to open up some type of what's the word again?  sarcophagus sarcophagus sarcophagus right and what what tool does he bring a  Paint brush not a hammer or crowbar or some kind of mallet 
[20:00]
 They were hinged the things just opened right up opened right up for the camera and he's reading these hieroglyphics on there  Who knows if he's telling it see this is the king and he was buried here  Looks like a rock hit it made a mark  How do we know who knows?  All right, let's rock for a while  John the okay keep calling if you got something good for the show 
[20:30]
 One oh two seven W any W the rock of New York Pearl Jam live this time around doctor from live on two legs  It's open Anthony the post is hysterical. What do you mean? The post is hysterical?

Oh  friend of mine  Yeah, she thought she goes I got a Monica Joe for him like  Tim I do a radio show and every day four hours a day  We've heard every joke man. I guess I haven't heard this one. Here Monica is  Suing her plastic surgeon. Why well she went in there to get her  Love handles removed. Yeah, and she left the doctor's office and she had no ears

[23:30]
 Me, that's fine. You can have Gary Howey the goo-goo dolls and I'll pick everybody up in a limo  We gotta mention of course he's where were you born Jersey and he came was raised down south  No, I born and raised in Jersey. I lived in Atlanta for one year. Well, that must have put the tinge on it  Yeah, they screwed you up in Atlanta something happened. It's like some kind of mutated accent 
[24:00]
 I don't know what I've heard of any other person coming out of Jersey. That sounds quite like you Roger now  So I have a friend that left a message yesterday on my phone machine  She says that there is nobody who sounds more like a New Yorker than I do and why I don't know  You got a wacky little accent, I don't think New Yorkers  Jersey in there without a doubt, but there's something else going on in there. I know can't figure out  Yeah, no one's like, you know, how how how we in New York 
[24:30]
 All right, well we'll let him off the hook. Thanks Roger. You're welcome. Everyone go down to Carol. It's a definitely  It's a great cause. All right  I'm a all right  We got to get a couple things out of the way here still getting a ton of people sending out instant feedback about  Sables naked pictures from Playboy  Yeah, yeah for some reason people just can't get this address, right? If you want to see the pictures of Sable naked  Before it hits newsstands, which is next week Sable from WWF the website once again, you need to be a good speller 
[25:00]
 Okay, it's  www.  latest wrestling news all one word no spaces latest wrestling news  dot-com  Here's the complicated part  backslash pwp  Just think Pusky whipped Pusky  Popeye wants Pusky. There you go. So it's latest wrestling news dot-com backslash 
[25:30]
 Popeye wants Pusky now people are gonna write that in  Pwp pwp latest wrestling news dot-com backslash pwp. What's wrong?  I think they may have pulled it for legal reasons. You might want to check that address real quick  See they got us  Yeah, they finally got us. Well, that's fine  We still had a few thousand of our listeners took out the pictures for free. Yeah Playboy screwing us over  We had an interview booked with Sable and then we were told we're not allowed to do it because King Howard 
[26:00]
 Said no one else is allowed to interview Sable before he does. Yeah  Yeah, that sounds like something he would have bitched about years ago, right I believe yeah  Who I don't know what the big deal is because he also said we have three we have three listeners  So three listeners Robin  Do they really pull the pics I don't want my imitators getting my guests Robin 
[26:30]
 All right, well we'll check the website make sure it's still there  If it's not that's too bad you should have seen them yesterday should have learned how to spell wrestling  I'm writing  wrestling  res  All right more stupidity on the way guaranteed  1027 WNEW the Iraq of New York Metallica whiskey in the jar from garage. Inc  You're hanging with Ophi and Anthony and I guess everyone is talking about the the big interview tonight Anthony who cares? 
[27:00]
 Exactly  We're having a little fun with it. Yeah  earlier in the show  We we were discussing the fact that  Monica picked the wrong person interview her Barbara Walters  It's gonna be a fluff piece bar Walters gonna ask stupid questions about if you were a tree  What type of tree would you be she was trying to get her to?  She's on the view this morning saying, you know, if we're having people come in because we need a new another host 
[27:30]
 You know, they fired Debbie. Yeah, and they were pitching her for the job  Monica if you want to come in and host the show. Yeah, just kissing her ass  Knowing it would just be a ratings boom, of course, and then they would get rid of her  She's gonna be yesterday's news just like Donna Rice and the rest of the host. Remember that? Yeah  The other ones that helped certain politicians trip over their own schween on the way to the White House, right?  Yeah, there you go. So we thought that  That  You know, there are there are other people that should have interviewed Monica and it would have made for much more 
[28:00]
 Riveting TV Anthony because there's no surprises with Barbara Walters  You're not gonna get anything that you're not expecting  But there's a few people that I think could have interviewed Monica and we would have gotten some surprises some fun  Yeah earlier we thought you know a good interview with Monica would have been dice dice  We're gonna write interviewer. He would have got to the  The questions everyone wants to know the answer still. Yes. Who else do we have earlier Tom Brokaw?  Yeah, another fine journalist stumbling over trying to say the L in Lewinsky and then our favorite Yoshi 
[28:30]
 Yes that I would want I would sit for two hours and watch Yoshi interview Monica Lewinsky. Mm-hmm  Well, we've come up with a few more I guess Anthony Oh, no  No, instead of Barbara Walters interviewing Monica. Mm-hmm. What would it sound like if I don't know?  Popeye. Ah, well Popeye very popular cartoon character. What would that sound like if Popeye?  interviewed Monica 
[29:00]
 Monica Lewinsky's so you reminds me of a sea hag  Can you blow smoke rings with your busky?  Let's try get with me pipe  Takes the big puffs with that fat busky  You 
[29:30]
 Sit home and listen to that of course with questions like those are the questions I want to hear of course  Who else do we think of that wouldn't be a good interviewer for Monica, let's say  How about Howard Howard? Yeah, Howard Stern, of course interviews a lot of people  I think that would be interesting to watch he would have a different angle on the whole thing  I believe yes a little different than Barbara's so Howard Stern interviewing Monica. What would that sound like? 
[30:00]
 Hey, honey, look at you, huh? I would do you  That can't you Robin right Jackie, huh?  Hey, you're hot  Hey take off that top honey, let's see those can  Watch that that would be a lot of fun. I don't know if I can handle that for two hours 
[30:30]
 Maybe for five or six minutes. Sure, you know something a little different funny  You can probably catch that type interview every Saturday night  But yeah, I would tune in yeah more so than Barbara I would have to check that out who else would be good to interview  On Monica Lewinsky  Well, who else could you think of it and uh Captain Kirk?  William Shatner William Shatner. Why not? I wonder what that would sound like William Shatner interviewing Monica Lewinsky 
[31:00]
 Monica you're a  Beautiful woman so full and  Sanctuous I'm wondering is your oral technique more like that of the oneself creatures of the den of a colony  That latch on to their prey sucking and sucking till they're  lifeless and live or more like the salt sucking monsters of Kamas to answer  You've got an ass like Goora and your mouth looks like the doomsday machine 
[31:30]
 Destroyed the USS Constellation and killed Commodore Decker  and inviting I  Would tune into that too, I believe I would do it sure be there in a second  Wow, okay  Fascinating. Let's see. Who else can we think of? I think we need more time here. Yeah, maybe maybe quirky Steinbrenner  I don't know quirky good  Anyone else come to mind that maybe would be a good interviewer for Monica maybe 
[32:00]
 Reverend al Reverend al might be good. Well stick around me. We got some tape of that as well. All right  The rag of New York 1027 WNW that slide from the goo-goo dolls. It's opiate Anthony bag and  Charles Manson's in the paper again. Oh really? This is this great. He's taking part in a college class  What?  Charles Manson serving life in prison for one of the most infamous mass murders in American history will defend himself at a new trial this fall 
[32:30]
 Unfortunately for Manson the trial will be of the mock variety part of a course on the American jury system taught at Newman University  In Wichita, Kansas, but that hasn't discouraged Manson from taking the stand in his own defense  Something he didn't do at his trial  Are you kidding?  Not kidding. How would they do this?  Like  Let him out so he could go to this thing. No, I'm sure they're gonna just set it all up in in the prison 
[33:00]
 Does anyone realize this guy's just a stark raving lunatic?  He's not even coherent when he talks. No, no what I find funny every what three or four years  You know Manson comes up for parole. Oh, yeah  Yeah, you know the papers and everything Manson up for parole for parole  He's got the parole board and they they walk him in they they show the footage on TV every three or four years  Just a wasted time.

See you're you're on the inside  And you can't sit and judge him to me being on the inside  I'm on outside because within me in my mind is the outside world  But you're not a part of that world see I am the person in charge of my world on the inside out

It's about the  little bigger than a condom box and  inside is a  No, what this is it looks like a sock with the heel missing 
[41:30]
 Kids sock looks like a kid sock with the heel missing  alright, and I  Guess the concept is that you put this over your unit  When you want to masturbate  This guy has no doll a spanking hanky yes, thank you. Yes  for cleanliness, huh, so so you can  Was there a need for this?  There's such an outcry that 
[42:00]
 guys  Chad's from Vancouver  Chad and figures Canadians. Hey, you need your spanky  Hey, don't go out without your spanky you be a hoser  Purely device to unload  Hope he just spit his water out on the board  Well better than that, oh come on I didn't say anything 
[42:30]
 That doesn't feel bad at all using it now now  Do people throw these in the washing machine after they're done or  Yeah, actually, they're completely washable  We actually sell a little you know you can buy just a spanky a lot of people buy it obviously as a gag gift  You know, it's great to send to you know  Somebody at work to kind of bust on him or your congressmen or obviously politicians these days are pretty uh, right targets  Right, we should send some to Clinton 
[43:00]
 Oh  That's wacky zanerrific. Sorry is better. Why can you actually?  We sell a wash bag that you can put the spankies in and throw it in the laundry  So kind of discreetly you're not gonna you know have one fall out in the floor in the laundry  Well, that would be embarrassing at the laundromat exactly. Yeah, then these things don't shrink up in the wash  Do they well if you fired them in the dryer for long enough?  They probably would but you know, we we kind of say one size fits most  Yeah, yeah, man. Any complaints that you know  Hey, I don't fit in a spanky 
[43:30]
 We did so we created the giant spanky which is about two feet long and a foot across  So we think that should pretty much cover the base. Yes. We saw that spanking  We try to give it to a black Earl one of the guys that works on our show  He laughed at the size of the spanking. Yeah, he said the regular spanking would not fit over his unit  And the giant spanking I like the spanky is also come in the frat pack  I  Vibing up any stag birthday or keg or office party with 24 
[44:00]
 spankies  Exactly. Well, yeah, I mean, you know, you got the obviously a fraternity guys or you got a big stag party, you know, they  Perfect gift perfect gift just seem all sitting around using their spanking  Well, I'm amazed. I don't even like using handkerchiefs like a hanky  You know you blow people blow their nose in a hanky and put it in their pocket and then later on wash it  You're just thinking of of snot with your clothes now think about it 
[44:30]
 You know, you have your spanking in the washing machine with your shirts and maybe mom's  Stuff if you're a kid, you know, isn't that a little weird?  People I mean people have their you know sheets  They throw in the laundry and a lot of stuff goes on in those two.

[45:30]
 Or they can call triple eight you yank it  We got those numbers here. Well, you know if you if you're doing radio stuff, you ought to have some humorous spanking stories  You know have some people send you there the the fun they've had with their spankies  You know that way you could do you could tell them over the air  You're exactly right. It's not something that a lot of people are you know  Volunteering too many stories so far but uh, cuz you kind of sound like you've been spanking it a lot today 
[46:00]

 Hey, how you doing?  It's Phil.  How are you man?  Good.  Love the spanky.  You love the spanky, why?  I love the spanky man.  Why?  Good idea.  I bet you the guy who invented it was a sailor.  Why?  The reason why I'm saying that is because I was a sailor and my best friend out at sea  racking out in a rack was a dirty magazine and an old sock.  So you would have been able to use the spanky.  What's that?  You would have been able to use the spanky then.  Oh absolutely, yeah.  Yeah, a friend of the seaman.

We're all patiently waiting for Kevin, our intern, who is whacking it for our show today. 
[49:00]
 What's going on?  He's still going.  No one's down there guarding the door.  He left a half hour ago with the spanky.  He's been in there for a while.  He's really not done yet.  No.  Yeah, that must be the pressure.  You think?  Yeah.  We did hear the toilet flush.  That was the only thing we heard come out of it.  Well he shouldn't be flushing anything.  He's got a spanky.  He's got the spanky.  He's supposed to use the spanky for everything.  I guess eventually we'll talk to our intern Kevin when he's done.  Hey, what's the camera crew out there for?  What is that Ben? 
[49:30]
 What's going on out there?  Something Carol's being filmed.  I don't know exactly for what.  Really?  Wow.  What's it for?  How come no one gives us answers?  It's like camera crews going through the N.E.W. studios and we have no clue what they're for.  Well they want to see what a living legend does for a show and stuff.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I didn't know.  What channel is it for?  I think it's MSG or something like that.  It's a big honor.  Oh really?  MSG? 
[50:00]
 It's something like that.  I'm not exactly sure.  See look, it's all very vague.  Just love to know what's going on.  Eddie, you know right?  What's that?  Eddie Trunk?  The board op and doer everythinger on Carol's show?  What?  Oh, it's the Saturday Night Rocks.  Oh yes, yes, of course.  Come on man.  Tell me you know.  That's true.  We talked about your cute Saturday Night Rocks.  Rocks, man.  When the other stations are on, you're like, oh, I'm going to be on Saturday Night Rocks.  I'm going to be on Saturday Night Rocks.  I'm going to be on Saturday Night Rocks.  I'm going to be on Saturday Night Rocks.  I'm going to be on Saturday Night Rocks.  I like to be, you know, associated with that. 
[50:30]
 So what's going on with the camera crew?  Yeah.  No one will tell us what the camera crew is all about.  You know, I don't know.  I guess they're doing a piece for MSG.  I think it's MSG Network.  About the station or about Carol?  I'm not sure if it's Carol or if it's the whole station or what, but I know that Carol  is like the host of it.  Oh, no, because if it's about the station, that's good to have Carol represent the station.  No, that's good.  Oh, really?  I'm saying that's a good thing.  What? 
[51:00]
 What?  I know that they'll be filming during, I guess, her first hour, two hours of her show.  They're going to film her show today.  Yeah.  And outside of that, I just know it's MSG.  I think it's that Metro channel.  Okay.  But I don't.  Oh, right, right.  Okay.  So, the nature of the pieces, you know what the pitch is.  Is that the word, the lingo you use?  Pitch.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Well, good.  I wore a nice shirt today.  Yeah, I noticed. 
[51:30]
 Always looking like the slob that I am, you know.  But you do everything for the show, so shouldn't they be filming you?  Isn't that the weather and traffic channel?  I swear, I think I tuned it on and all of a sudden they show this camera view of the  LIE or something.  The BQE and stuff and it's like, hey, here it is.  It's actually three different channels.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  One's like education, one's traffic and weather.  Right.  Like I think things happening in the metro area.  What are they adding, a comedy channel?  What?  What?  I'm just wondering. 
[52:00]
 All right.  Maybe they'll come in here and maybe guys some...  No, I don't think any cameras will be rolling in here.  No, they will not be talking to us.  All right, Anthony, big interview tonight as we change the subject.  Yes.  Monica being interviewed by Barbara Walters.  And we thought they could have came up with someone else to interview Monica for the big  interview tonight.  Yeah, Barbara.  There's going to be no surprises there. 
[52:30]
 It's going to be the same dull interview she does with everybody else.  There'll be a couple of moments of laughter, a couple of moments of tears and absolutely  no surprises.  Right.  Same questions, all the information we've heard already through the news for the past  year.  Right.  We've got a bunch of people that we thought would be better interviewers than Barbara  Walters.  Yes, hold our interest a little more.  So let's start with Tom Brokaw.  Respected newsman.  Yes.  Maybe he should have gotten a shot at this.  Yeah.  Now what would that sound like again, Anthony? 
[53:00]
 Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  We're here with Monica Lowen.  Monica Lowen.  We're here with Monica Lowen.  We'll be right back after these words.  Mr. Marble Mouth, a little trouble, but I would tune in and watch him stumble over the  L.  Of course.  I think he would only get one question out in two hours, but it would be interesting.  Better than Barbara.  Just the same. 
[53:30]
 And then we came up with Yoshi.  Oh yeah, Yoshi.  Yoshi's a favorite.  I think I would sit and watch that for two hours, Yoshi interviewing Monica.  Absolutely.  What would that sound like?  Monica Lewinsky, you are very dishonored.  Did you write a Clinton plaque?  And I want to know, did he poke you?  Yeah, I'd be there.  Two hours.  Two hours of that short. 
[54:00]
 Of course.  Why not?  Now, and our favorite, Anthony.  Yes, our favorite.  Instead of having Barbara Walters interview Monica, I think it would be a much more exciting  interview if Andrew Dice Clay interviewed Monica tonight for two hours on ABC.  I'd be there for that.  What the hell would that sound like?  All right, I'd like to welcome this whale to my show, huh?  And you know you're a whale because I can see your blowhole.  Yay!  So, you're sucking Clinton's ****, right?  Does he blow his **** on that chubby face of yours? 
[54:30]
 Or does he pull out and **** all over your big ****, huh?  Come on.  Answer the question.  Answer the question, you whore!  Answer the question!  Oh, look, now she's going to cry?  Get on Barbara Walters, you're going to cry, huh?  You'll look at her a little bit.  Answer the question!  Watch your mouth, fool!  You **** whore!  Look at this **** bag, huh?  I don't want you on my **** show!  Get the **** out of here, you **** **** **** **** ****! 
[55:00]
 How would you not tune into that?  That's much better than Barbara.  I would love to hear two hours of that.  Yeah!  You know?  All right, Anthony, we're still waiting for intern Kevin to finish up with the spanky  that we were talking about earlier.  He's up to 40 minutes and counting.  And Rick, our producer, went upstairs with the cell phone to see what the hell is going on.  Rick! 
[55:30]
 Hey, guys.  Hey, what's up?  We got you live in the air.  I'm standing outside the bathroom door, which is all the way down the hall on the other  side of the building.  Yeah.  And I'm looking and I don't see any movement around.  This is weird.  I can't partially see anything.  Hey, Rick.  Hey, Rick.  Rick, move out of the bathroom.  We can't hear you.  Move out of the bathroom?  Yeah.  You're breaking up.  Okay, I'm away from the bathroom.  Well, I don't see any story.  I don't hear anything in there.  What do you think?  Should I bang on the door? 
[56:00]
 Yeah, bang on the door.  Yeah, yell at him.  See what's going on.  Hurry up.  Hey, Jeff.  How you doing in there?  Almost there.  Almost there?  Almost there.  If he says almost there, then he's not almost there anymore.  Yeah, he's been at it for 28 minutes, dude.  No, try 38 minutes.  What's he falling in love?  What did he say?  All right, he said he's got a problem taking out a good picture from Penthouse.  Oh, what a...  So...  Get him a copy of Blue Boy or something. 
[56:30]
 What the hell is wrong with him?  I'll get him over 50 magazine.  Maybe that'll help him.  Yeah.  All right, listen, we've got to talk about Priceline for a minute.  Stay on the line just in case something happens, all right?  You got it.  All right.  There's Rick upstairs wondering what the hell's going on with our intern, Kevin, as he spanks  it.  Well, over to the spanking.  Perhaps if he had the privacy of a hotel room, it would go a lot faster.  But you're saying how could an intern afford a hotel room here in New York?  Yeah.  Well, maybe if he got in touch with Priceline at 1-800-Priceline or the website Priceline.com, 
[57:00]
 he could name his own price for that hotel room and be spanking it in there now at his  price, not the hotel's price.  Exactly.  He would be able to name his own price for the hotel room and Priceline would get back  to him and say, okay, this is what you're going to save on that hotel room.  And let's say he just wants one day in there and he uses Priceline service.  What will he get, Opie?  That's a free hotel night, Anthony, for a whole other day of using the spanking. 
[57:30]
 That's right.  Yes.  It's a great service.  If you're going away in the near future, you might as well at least call them up and see  what they can do for you.  We all want to save money, right?  Doesn't hurt.  Tax season almost upon us.  We're all worried about how much money we're going to have to pay the damn government.  We're going to try to save money any way we can.  So give them a call.  All right, Rick.  Yo.  Any update for us?  All right.  Well, hold on.  Let me panel the door again.  Hey, Kev, you alive in there? 
[58:00]
 I don't know.  Did you hear that?  What did he say?  He said, I got to stop banging on the door.  It's breaking his concentration.  So he's still working at it.  All right.  Probably got hand cramps by now using his feet.  All right.  Well, hopefully we'll talk to Kevin, the intern who's spanking upstairs before we get off  the air at seven o'clock.  This is amazing.  He's going to hurt himself.  Exactly.  Hurry up, man.  We're running out of time.  You can't hurry.  I've got to...  He's got anxiety pressure now, man.  All right?  All right, guys.  We'll check in in a bit.  All right, cool. 
[58:30]
 One, oh, two, seven, W, N, E, W, the Rock of New York, the Colts, Fire Woman and Hole  before that, Malibu from Hole's latest CD, Celebrity Skin.  Hole and Marilyn Manson coming to town April 6th, Continental Arena and the Coliseum on  the 7th of April.  And it's Opie and Anthony and our show has completely come to a halt.  Yeah, we're waiting.  We're waiting for the show to come to a halt.  We're waiting for the show to come to a halt.  We're waiting for the show to come to a halt.  We're waiting for the show to come to a halt.  We're waiting for the show to come to a halt.  We're waiting for the show to come to a halt. 
[59:00]
 Come on.  But, but, but the cameraman just outside says he loves the show and he says he's willing  to try and do it right as quick as he can for you guys to see if it works.  The cameraman wants to use the spanky?  Yep.  All right, give him a spanky.  But tell him he's not filming us.  That's a fresh spanky, by the way.  Tell him.  It's a fresh spanky.  Well, we got these spankies as a stupid product.  Hey, dude, what's up?  How you doing, man? 
[59:30]
 Big fan of the show.  All right.  Thanks.  I want to need some kind of material, though.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  What's your pleasure?  Swank.  Gay, straight by.  Penhouse.  Penhouse, man.  All right.  Take one of the penthouses away from intern Kevin.  Hey, how's the taping going?  Cool.  OK.  Good.  What did you say?  What?  It's lengthy.  Lengthy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  No surprise there.  All right. 
[60:00]
 All right.  Well, we're getting you some material so you can spank it for us to let us know what the  spanky is all about, OK?  I average about 15 minutes, though.  15?  15?  I'm a long-goer, you know?  No, our intern's been in there for ... He's a half hour.  And it was before six.  Why is that break?  It's 45 minutes.  45 minutes.  Yeah, I only have about 10.  Let's put the pressure on it.  All right.  We'll get your material and you can try it out for us.  So probably finish before the intern does.  Yeah.  All right.  Now the race is on.  So what do you think of the spanking?  You got it in your hand there.  It looks like a puppet.  It does, right? 
[60:30]
 Isn't it?  Like a little hand puppet or something.  It looks like a little hand puppet.  Hi, I'm a spanky.  How you doing?  It's lampshade everywhere.  My new job.  I'm a spanky.  This is great.  And it's a little small.  Yeah, I think so.  Well, it's just made ... I mean, I'm an Irish guy, but I'm still thinking, yeah, it's a  little small.  And it might even be ... Well, it's not round.  It's round enough, but definitely not long enough.  I don't think you'll have a problem filling that spanky.  I'll fill it to the top for you. 
[61:00]
 Come on.  All right.  Is there any word on our intern?  No.  I was just down there.  Eddie, back in the studio.  I was just down there, and Earl's like, keep an eye on that door because we don't want  anybody walking in on them.  And one of the maintenance guys with the giant thing of towels starts kicking on the door  to go in.  I said, dude, don't go in there.  He didn't understand what I was saying.  It might have set him back a few minutes or whatever.  All right.  Well, we only need to work, and he's going to need the spanky as a tourniquet. 
[61:30]
 You need to get him some live action, man.  I don't know about you guys, but the picture thing died in my teens.  You need live action.  I'd ask Jane Persil if she'd help.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, this is kind of bizarre because our intern has been whacking it for 45 minutes.  It's got to be chasing it.  What is up in there?  Got any lube in there?  It's got the spanky.  You know, there's a spanky, you know.  All right.  Hopefully, Kevin will be done before we get off the air at 7 o'clock.  This hasn't been used, has it? 
[62:00]
 No, no.  That's a fresh spanky.  That's a fresh spanky.  So hot off the presses.  All right.  Well, I broke out this little ditty from the Opie and Anthony archives where we are talking  about spanking it.  Which one do you got?  What do you have?  Ah, yes.  I haven't heard that one in a while.  Damn, I love that song.  One of the many tracks off our Demand A World CD, blah, blah, blah. 
[62:30]
 Good luck trying to find it in New York.  Yeah.  He's not done?  No.  All right.  We got to take a break.  We got to talk to him before 7, so.  Or right around 7 o'clock.  But the camera guy.  The camera guy is over.  He came to Gallery magazine.  He was happy.  Oh, Gallery will work.  Slop.  All right.  So the camera guy is going to just try not to spank you right now?  Yep.  All right.  Still patiently waiting for Kevin, our intern, to finish up.  And now we've got the camera guy that is around here filming something. 
[63:00]
 He's spanking in the bathroom too.  Hopefully, one of them will be done before this song is over.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, Johnny Lang playing the Hammerstein Ballroom March 10th.  Tickets still available.  We'll all be there to hang out with him.  And he's coming in to do our show Tuesday.  Yes.  Tuesday he's coming in to play live, Johnny Lang.  And then we're going to also talk to Sammy Hagar next Tuesday.  Sammy.  That show will be much more interesting than the one you're currently listening to. 
[63:30]
 It's getting outrageous.  You know, we thought we'd do a quick little goof break, you know.  We found this new stupid product called the Spanky.  You put it over your Johnson and you whack it and then you don't mess yourself.  So we said, OK, Kevin, our new intern, you know, you've got to take one for the team.  You're the new guy.  So we sent him down the hall an hour ago.  It was 555.  An hour.  With the Spanky.  And he's still in the bathroom. 
[64:00]
 Earl, do you have an update?  55 minutes.  You got him on the clock, right?  I put him on the clock.  55 minutes.  And he has completely wrecked our show.  We wanted to move on.  He's coming.  Well, is he entering?  What happened?  All right, wait a minute.  All right, now it gets more interesting.  So we have to get this.  You keep the Spanky in your pocket.  OK, listen.  All right.  Intern Kevin did not just come into the studio.  What's your name again?  Your real name?  Oh, you didn't give out your name.  Indigo J. 
[64:30]
 All right.  There's a camera guy here that is filming something that no one is going to want to see.  That no one is going to watch.  But anyway.  We're not Trafficking Weather.  All right.  But we're the guide.  The camera guy is there.  Oh, the guide.  All right.  We already know what to do.  He tells you where the Trafficking Weather is.  OK.  Now, the camera guy loves our show.  So he said he would try out the Spanky.  You went in the bathroom, what, 15 minutes ago?  What happened?  First of all, the Spanky is too thick. 
[65:00]
 OK?  You can't even feel anything.  Number one.  Number two.  The Spanky falls off.  Uh-oh.  You know, and you're left back to where you normally are.  OK?  And number three, your bathroom is kind of cold.  I got certain elements working against me.  And I'm standing up.  You know?  All right.  Well, you're poor on the Spanky.  Not a rousing review.  Well, could someone just...  Two shweens down for the Spanky.  Grab Kevin and tell him it's all over.  He's got to come back into the studio so we can all laugh at him. 
[65:30]
 No one...  Black Earl running down the hall.  Hurry up, Earl!  Earl's going to get Kevin.  Nobody can use the Spanky.  You know, the bookkeeper who's 53 years old.  He didn't like the gallery.  Yeah, what issues did you get?  Oh, he got the girl next door.  Oh, it's nasty.  The hosebag next door issue.  All right, Roger.  While we get Kevin real fast, you got like 20 seconds to give the plug for the benefit tonight.  Great.  Tonight we're doing the benefit for the family of Matthew Zergowski, who was the officer 
[66:00]
 who was killed in Staten Island.  Great cause.  Yes.  Tonight at Carolines at 930.  Tickets are still available.  You can call Carolines 212-757-4100 or go directly.  They are available at the door.  We've got John Stewart, our own Sue Kalinsky, Louis Black, Bob Nelson, J.R.  Havelin, Paul Michael Mercurio.  They're both from the Daily Show.  David Tell and Mitch Patel.  They're all the way to the Daily Show. 
[66:30]
 We're really trying not to make fun of your.  All right, cool.  So it's 930 tonight and tickets still available, right?  Correct.  All right.  Thanks, Roger.  And Carol is not shown back.  So I think we can run a little longer.  We can run as long as we want, though.  Absolutely.  All right.  Where's Kevin?  Is he entering the studio?  All right.  He's on his way down the hall.  He's not very happy.  He feels like he's let the team down.  He definitely let the team down. 
[67:00]
 He did.  Every guy that's within 10 feet of the studio, come in the studio so we can all laugh at  Kevin.  Ben, I'm serious.  Get back here.  All right.  Here's Black girl.  Ben the bag.  Eddie.  Jimmy has entered the studio.  And here everyone is Kevin.  Come on.  What's the matter?  He has feet red.  What happened?  Wait, dude.  You were in the bathroom for an hour.  Yeah.  And you couldn't make it happen.  This doesn't do it.  I needed a movie.  A movie? 
[67:30]
 What?  I need a movie.  Come on.  Magazines don't do it.  Excuse me.  I need a live girl to be in bed with who will touch me and caress me.  I will then have sex with her.  Then I think it will work.  I need a movie.  A movie?  Movie?  What are we running here?  In a movie I would have been three minutes.  Me too.  Me too.  Doesn't work without a movie.  I understand.  I understand.  Movie. 
[68:00]
 Movie.  Turn the pages quick.  You know, Pee Wee, you could have used this.  Hey, it's Mr. Spanky.  Yeah, you could have used this.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  All right.  You could have used this, Spanky.  I have a talking Spanky.  It's a Spanky puppet.  Spanky puppet.  Hello?  Hello, Pee Wee?  Hi, I think Kevin's a fag. 
[68:30]
 That chick says Kevin's a fag.  I know what you mean, but even girls can get off on those magazines.  Yeah, because I don't even need a magazine to get off.  I could get off three times within an hour without a magazine.  All I can think of is one thing, he must have done it earlier in the day.  I hate that.  That was a long time.  All right, well thank you. 
[69:00]
 Well, Kev, you let us down, you know.  I could try again Friday.  Oh, Friday.  Friday.  You keep going until Friday.  Now did you have the spanky on at all times?  Or did you go spanky-less for a couple of spanks?  You had a dumb-ass.  We had a dumb-ass.  I don't know.  I didn't know I could.  I didn't know.  Wait a minute.  So according to the instructions, you have to be aroused. 
[69:30]
 Aroused would be a much better word to use.  And then you place it on.  And then you place it on.  Right.  And you couldn't even get past step one?  Wait a minute.  I got to step one and then when I place it on, it just loses the effect.  Huh.  Huh.  Well, it does.  It does.  That's true.  You're looking down at something that looks like the littlest Klan member.  You know?  Hey buddy, what do you got, man?  I can't believe it, man. 
[70:00]
 Three times the amount of time I was able to do it.  Yeah, definitely.  People were playing along at home, Kevin.  It was so pathetic.  Are you going to be chafing?  Do you feel like that it might have chafed a bit?  Because I'm looking at the spanking material thinking, I don't know, a little bit of friction  on this for some time.  It might hurt.  Well, I got the most exercise out of my hand just now.  Yeah, it's got calluses. 
[70:30]
 It's as hard as a paper towel.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's like a paper towel.  I don't know.  Hi, NW.  What's up with this guy, Kevin, man?  I don't know.  He let us down.  We thought he'd let everybody down.  We thought it would be a quick goof bit for our show and instead we just wasted the last  hour of our show.  All I know is I made four stops, got out of the car, got back in the car and he still  didn't do it.  Yeah.  He had to give up.  No.  He was sick.  He probably fell off. 
[71:00]
 All right, man.  All right.  Thank you.  Fire and blank.  It was almost there once.  Yeah.  But then it hurt Earl down here on the door.  Yeah.  That didn't help the situation.  Earl, I need some help.  Hi, NW.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Is that guy going to need a hand transplant now or what?  Yeah, did you try the left hand?  Yes, actually, because sometimes that works.  What happened with the pleasure of putting quicker picker up? 
[71:30]
 Or did it work out all right for you, Kevin?  No, he got it all at once, but then it just lost the effect for me.  Then I even tried water.  Water?  Water?  Water?  Water can't work.  Water?  Hi, NW.  Tell Ben to fag.  Watch out.  You got Kevin to fag now.  I don't think just because he couldn't complete the act, he should be dubbed a fag, as you 
[72:00]
 say.  No, he should have given him some blue boy.  Maybe it might have helped.  Even gay guys could, you know.  I need a movie or a live woman.  See, I'll back you up on that.  I agree with him that you need...  Wait, there's levels.  Listen, you start out with like I Dream a Genie as a little kid.  Shut up.  And then you move down the line.  I'm not going to listen to this.  A movie?  You need sound, live action.  I'm with him. 
[72:30]
 How old are you?  21.  So what?  By 30 it's going to be, I need torsos and heads.  No.  Is this going to keep getting worse and worse?  I have my favorite movies.  A movie?  Shut up.  I got 14 years on here.  What, Top Gun?  Fried green tomatoes.  I can take a picture of Martha Stewart and take care of myself.  What's a movie?  Well, it's a serious catalog.  Underwear is his own thing.  I don't know.  You have your own thing too.  It just doesn't work.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, how you doing? 
[73:00]
 Maybe you need lipstick on a Spanky.  All right.  Hello, Mr. Spanky.  Hello, Pee-wee.  Me and Mr. Spanky are going to go to the bathroom.  But I need a movie too.  I messed up my Spanky.  I don't know.  We're going to need somebody to do this.  I'll do it before we're done with spots. 
[73:30]
 You will not.  I'm a man.  You will not.  This does not make me any less interesting.  Wait, wait, wait.  I'll give you that challenge.  How much do you want to bet?  Someone's got to confirm this, though, dude.  We'll make Kevin confirm it because he was the...  No.  No.  Yes, I'm serious.  God, is that heinous?  This is ridiculous.  I feel like I'm to blame for this because it was my idea.  All right, here's the deal.  All right.  Let's get up a collection.  What? 
[74:00]
 This is the money involved?  I want to bet him.  Oh, you want to bet that he can't do it in what?  The spots.  One, two, one, two, three.  And you've got a live read, too.  A live read.  Let's call it five minutes.  Where's our...  Call it six.  All right, call it six minutes.  Where's our...  Six minutes.  Hold on.  Tell Earl to come in.  You'll be on the clock.  Hey, don't give him a head start.  He might be thinking erotic thoughts.  Earl.  I say no way.  Earl, come here.  You're going to be on the clock.  Rick, our producer, swears that...  He said, oh, clock.  All right, you got the watch, right?  All right, get ready to hit go. 
[74:30]
 Wait, it's six minutes from what?  When we hit the spots.  So he has to be...  Hold on, hold on.  There's no way he could do that.  There's 12 guys around.  No way.  How much money is in here?  You're convinced he could do it?  I'm convinced he could do it.  He's convinced he could do it.  He's convinced he could do it.  He's convinced he could do it.  He's convinced he could do it.  He's convinced he could do it.  Yeah, Hummock, we don't look at him.  And Kevin, you have to prove that he did it.  I'm sorry.  I won't. 
[75:00]
 If I can pull it off, I'll need...  No, I think Kevin already pulled it off.  I'll need surgery.  No, if I can do this in six minutes, you have to carry it in.  I could spike that monkey in four minutes.  Anthony, spike that monkey.  Take the soap out of there.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Anything that might resemble the byproduct.  Soap?  Go in there and take everything out.  No, because you might be able to take everything out of there that he could fake and put in 
[75:30]
 there.  Like what?  You know, like hand soap or something.  No, no, no, I know what you're talking about.  All right, now what are you going to use?  I'm going to use the latest issue of Penthouse.  Penthouse.  No, that's not fair.  I saw that issue.  No, no, it's a good one.  Yeah, get the soft soap out of there.  We took the soft soap out of there.  You just got that hard, you know, corporate toilet paper in there.  All right, there's nothing.  All right, ready?  Scrape my hand.  How much are we betting?  Yeah, how much do you want to give me?  I'm good for at least...  I don't know.  What do we got? 
[76:00]
 That's a...  Look at...  Ben goes, a buck.  I'll take that buck.  I'm going to pay for my parking.  All right, hold on.  Everyone, Andy up.  I'll bet ten bucks.  All right.  All right, it's a good one.  All right, if it's in for ten, I'm in for ten.  All right, that's 20 bucks.  Earl?  Five.  Five, really?  25.  Has anyone taken the action?  No, stop it!  Hey, the Humvee Queen's blowing in his ear!  Stop it!  Get your hands off of him!  I didn't get that.  My money's on Rick.  Your money's on Rick?  My money's on Rick.  Hold on, hold on. 
[76:30]
 One question.  One quick question.  Kevin, is that yours?  Yeah.  Can you put that back in your pocket?  Thank you.  You don't want to get your spanking confused.  All right, wait.  That would be gay.  I got one.  I got one.  I got one.  All right, let's collect the money.  I'm going to need the big one.  Ben, give me the big one.  Yeah.  All right.  No, my money's on Rick.  Your money's on Rick.  No one's taking your bet, though.  All right, his money's on Rick.  Ben's got ten in the pot.  I just put ten in.  That's 20.  All right, here's my ten.  All right, that's 30.  It's amazing how nervous I'm getting right now. 
[77:00]
 I know, that's why I'm doing this.  Actually, I got his three.  There's no way you're going to do this.  I'll put my three in.  The pressure is so on.  Oh, wait a minute, Opie.  Do you have pressure?  No, Aunt and I, we know about this.  Opie, wait a minute.  He is Hispanic.  All right, we're up to 33 bucks.  I could whack him.  We're going to give you six minutes on the clock.  Do you win, number queen?  A dollar yourself?  A dollar.  I only have five bucks.  All right, no, that's fine.  Give me two bucks. 
[77:30]
 Take the money.  Would you kiss me if I were a spanky, baby?  All right, 30 bucks, and you're going to get $30.  That's all right.  All right, 35 bucks.  That's all we got here?  That's fine.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Okay.  Is he going to match the money and pay us back?  He's going to have to.  He's betting.  All right, Anthony, why don't you just give the quick intro here.  I would think maybe the embarrassment of not pulling it off is worth 35 bucks.  Ladies and gentlemen, let's get ready.  All right, what is he up to? 
[78:00]
 He's got under four minutes left.  He's two and a half into it, right?  He's got three and a half minutes left.  Rick's got to complete the act in three and a half minutes.  Three and a half minutes.  All right, if you own a computer or are looking to buy a new computer, listen closely to the  following message.

 And that's all she wrote.  There's no way you can do...  I don't care who you are.  You're not going to come up with the goods.  Get Rick out of there before he makes an unnecessary mess.  He's all chafed.  It's over.  I knew we'd put the pressure on him with the money and everything.  Of course!  It doesn't work like that.  The pressure's on.  The pressure kills you.  What do you think?  You're home?  I don't feel that bad now.  Where is he? 
[80:00]
 Is he coming out?  Yeah.  Come on.  Get out of the bathroom.  He might be in that gray area right now.  No way, man.  Believe me, it's impossible.  All right, everyone take their money back.  Here you go.  Come on.  Who gave the 20?  I did that.  Give me the 10.  I gave the 10.  All right.  I gave the 10.  Well, tell Rick to come in here.  Now Rick owes us.  He's in Paris.  Where is he?  He's trying to... he's going to come in holding something in front of him. 
[80:30]
 I owe five bucks.  Yeah, yeah.  My money was on Rick.  I gave you 10 bucks.  All right, we'll take care of that.  Get Rick out of here.  He just screamed, what?  No, he's done, tell him.  What?  He lost the bet.  Get him out of the bathroom.  Get out of here.  He can hear our voices in there.  Rick, you lost.  Now get out of the bathroom.  I'm going to go.  I'm going to go.  I'm going to go.  I'm going to go.  I'm going to go.  I'm going to go.  I'm going to go.  I'm going to go.  Get out of the bathroom.  He probably turned the monitor off.  It's over.  Get out.  It's over.  It's over, baby. 
[81:00]
 Everyone's yelling at him.  He just went, oh.  What did he think?  What did he think?  It wasn't going to happen.  Six minutes?  What is he doing?  Building a relationship with a girl in penthouse?  He completely put the pressure on with the money.  I was up to the dinner and dancing portion of the evening.  It's done.  All right.  No, that's okay, Earl.  We'll sort it out.  We'll settle up later.  What do you think, Rick?  What do you think, Rick?  You were going to be able to do that? 
[81:30]
 Please put the spanky back in your pocket.  Don't leave the spank.  You're laying around like that.  I know how I feel.  Now what happened to you, man?  Look, he's all sweaty.  What a mess.  Sweating.  What happened?  I got so freaking close and then I hear, eh, eh, eh, eh.  I'm just like.  It was over.  But I was sweating.  Look at him.  He's all sweating and everything.  He always had a moment.  You know what the big problem was? 
[82:00]
 The first two minutes, it was just trying to coax him back out of his shell.  He was like, no, no, man.  Too much pressure.  Too much pressure.  I'm like, come on now.  Come on.  Let's do this.  We know what we're doing.  I'm like, come on.  I got to pay for my parking.  He's like, no, screw the parking.  I'll pay for it.  I was like, oh.  That's it.  All right.  Well, you lost, right?  Everyone let us down today.  So we still don't know what the spanky is all about.  Anyone else want to try? 
[82:30]
 You want to get something done, you might have to do it yourself.  Come on.  I didn't get a chance to put the damn thing on.  I'm not getting in there.  No, we.  No, no, no, no.  I don't know.  Oak talked a pretty big game a little earlier.  Don't you guys think?  Does the white guy's got little.  Oak?  Hi, any W.  He's not responding.  I'm not stupid.  Hi, any W.  How are you doing?  I was wondering what was the address for that web address?  I want for Sable.  Yeah.  I think they took the pictures down. 
[83:00]
 That's why I couldn't get through to them.  Just search a bunch of wrestling sites.  They're up all over the place.  Yeah, now they're all over the place.  Just do a search with Sable's name and you'll find them.  Yeah, I think they want you to pay to go see that stuff.  Nah, there's enough free sites around that are offering.  I wrote it down yesterday and left it at work.  All right.  I'm sorry, dude, but I think they took them down because we were publicizing it so much  yesterday.  All right, great.  Thanks.  Bye.  Hi, any W.  Hey.  Hey, what's up?  That was strike three.  I think you guys have just proved that they took the dust cover for Viagra patients. 
[83:30]
 Yeah, I don't know about the spanky.  Yeah, we didn't have much luck with the spanky today.  It might be good for keeping dust off the VCR, keep it warm, something like that.  It's a little dust rag.  Put it on your hand and dust off your VCR.  I can hear the dog.  I don't get dirt on my condom.  All right, I guess we got to wrap up this mess.  That's it.  Yeah, well, the spanky, not very successful today.  Hi, any W. 
[84:00]
 Hey, Opi.  Yeah.  Yo, listen.  Yeah.  That was a cheap shop paying that stupid, stereophactic, kookamonga commercial.  If he was listening, there was no way he was going to get it up.  I know, but we had all sorts of tricks.  We knew there was no way that he would be able to come.  That was just not happening.  He wasn't going to complete the act in six minutes because, first of all, we put so much  money on the line.  I mean, 35 bucks to Rick is a lot of money.  I do work here.  And then we're doing live reads, knowing he's hearing our voice, and then to top it off, 
[84:30]
 he's got...  Stereotactic radio surgery for metastasis of the neck, head, chest, penis.  You're like, yeah, this is making me hot.  Yeah.  Stereotactic radio surgery for cappuccino of the chin, heel, leg, click clacks of the  chest, tumors of the penis, balls, penis.  Come on.  Then my pager went off.  Did it?  Yeah.  That's your chick.  What the hell is he doing?  All right, man.  Your pager went off.  Your pager went off. 
[85:00]
 Something else.  I guess we've got to get out of here.  Yeah, that's it.  We have to...  Big letdown with the spanky, but more stability tomorrow.  Well, take your spankies home and see how they work in the privacy of your own home.  And let us have it back tomorrow.  Yeah, Kevin, take a spanky, Rick, take a spanky.  You'll have a movie or whatever kind of high-jinks you got.  I need a trapeze.  I can't do without a trapeze.  All right, we're out of here.  Thanks for listening, guys.
