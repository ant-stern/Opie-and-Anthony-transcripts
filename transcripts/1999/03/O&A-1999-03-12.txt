 The Rock of New York, 1027 WNAW, Collective Soul, the world I know. All this weekend you  got chances to win tickets to see Collective Soul and the next chance to win is in the  four o'clock hour so stick around for that. Hey, it's Hope, it's Ann and it's FU Friday.  Can I throw the first one out? Yeah, sure. Okay, this is to people that get into little  fender benders on their way to work or whatever and decide they have to leave the cars exactly  where they are. Like the police are going to come and sketch it out. Like no one's hurt, 
[00:30]
 there isn't a problem. You dented your fender, the other guy scratched the bumper, but they  leave it there thinking it's a crime to move them. People actually think it's a crime to  move vehicles after you bump into each other. A fender bender. Right, like it'll be a, I've  got a hit and run, it'll be a hit and run. You can move your cars off the roadway. To  the side. Right, you don't have to block everyone's traffic while they're trying to get in because 
[01:00]
 you scratched your fender. The police don't come take measurements and photos. Don't worry,  move your car. Move along. It happened to us today. Yes it did. Where was that? Francis  Lewis Boulevard? Yeah, we're on the expressway. We're on the LIE. We're in bumper to bumper  traffic for what? 15, 20 minutes. Yeah, it's because somebody on the off ramp, Francis  Lewis Boulevard, stopped because of a little fender bender on the off ramp. Right. And 
[01:30]
 that backed up onto the expressway and blocked traffic on the expressway. I'm passing by  thinking they have no clue standing down there with their little fender bender that they  have just blocked all the traffic on the expressway. Big F you to them. Huge. I was in the supermarket  getting my lunch. Just wanted to get one of those chicken roasters. Right. Should take  how long to get that? Oh God, any more than five minutes is too long. Try 20. I'm in the  express lane and we've talked about this before. You know, during the day is the worst time 
[02:00]
 to hit a supermarket. First of all, it's when old people attack. Yeah. All the blue dots  are in the supermarket. Just want to get my quick lunch. I'm behind this lady. She had  to count out exact change to $4 and 66 cents. Dude, it took five minutes. She opens up the  tiny little purse that she hasn't opened up in years because you saw the dust and the  cobwebs, you know, the little change first and then she hands the guy $4 and then she's 
[02:30]
 counting out the 66 cents and everyone in line is just sighing. There's a bunch of work  people just trying to get back to the job and stuff. Yeah. That's what you get. You  get the old people that this is their time out too. This is like going out to them. Going  to the store to you is, you know, I got to go to the store, pick something up. I want  to get in and get out to the elderly. They go to the store to, to commune with each other  and talk. It's a social occasion. You're good. Like everything, if you're in the aisle and  you're buying soup, you know, and there's an old person next to you that's some pretty  good soup there you got. I've noticed that my store really binds up with that one. You're 
[03:00]
 going to enjoy that. Have a great little day now. You can buy two cans. It's like this,  this is their little way to get out. It's sort of sad, but I don't have the time. You  know, you want to get in, get out. And then the change purse. Well, then she, she counts  out the four 66 and then she decides, wait a minute, I got four quarters here. Can I  have a dollar back? I want to give you the four quarters for the dollar. And it's just  like, God, will you hurry up? It's just so annoying. The best is when you pull up to 
[03:30]
 the supermarket and you see the bus parked out front. Oh yeah. You know, they just let  off about what 30 or 40 senior citizens to go shopping. You hear them click clacking  through the, through the aisles with their walkers. Sounds like the velociraptors in  the cloth world. Oh no, old people. Walkers. Hello. Frightening. I love the people that, 
[04:00]
 you know, will call us and say, have compassion. You'll be old someday too. Now when we're  that old, you can make fun of us. Yeah, exactly. I got the youth and I got the legs and I want  to use them. Get out of my way. Get out of the way. All right. We've kicked off every  Friday. All right. Two one two seven five seven one oh two seven. If you want to talk  to us live with your FU's, the facts line two one two nine five seven W-N-E-W. If you're  going to write a fax, get right to the point because we get so many faxes that the ones 
[04:30]
 that have a real long story, we just throw away. To be honest with you, get right to  the point and we'll get you on the air. And then the instant feedback is a great way to  go to the W-N-E-W website, click on our pictures and you can send an email to us right here  in the studio. I'll be this like free or Frustrations Friday that they do on Fox on  their little Fox Morning show on Channel five. They're doing Free or Frustrations Friday  and they urge people to fax in what annoys them around New York City. Fascinating. Well, 
[05:00]
 there's another station that ripped this idea off as well. Really? And they're not going  to go unnoticed today. Z100's March Madness Contest is an exact rip off of this FU Friday  concept. Yeah, they're doing that March Madness March Madness. Tell us what makes you mad  this March. Oh, yeah. Make believe you guys came up with that on your own. Good day, New  York. That's who's doing it. I guess Julie Golden must have thought up that idea in a  drunken stupor. The weather girl. That's a big story today. Well, the girl from the Fox 
[05:30]
 show. Good day, New York. She got pulled over for a D-Way at one thirty in the afternoon.  Man, that's a good lunch. Maybe Fox adopted Gary's idea that didn't quite work around  here. Free beer Thursday. You know, and she might have been doing a few and trying to  drive home. All right, Julie. But she didn't take the breathalyzer. No. Hello? Yeah, what's 
[06:00]
 up? Hi, I have an FU. All right, you're live on the air. What do you got? I want to say  I'm going to ask you to my third grade. Why? Because they just nonstop talking. Well, they're  third graders. And two of my friends can go out of class. Oh, what are they doing? Peeing  their pants? Damn them. It's awful. What are they? Eating the paste? They nap all the time.  They just don't shut up. And it's Friday. But they're kids. But they're kids, you know?  That's what you're supposed to do as a kid. How long have you been teaching? This is our 
[06:30]
 fifth year. Well, my fifth year. How long have you been teaching? So, like, what is your  goal? To be a college professor or something? You got to work your way up from wet diapers?  Do you get to see the peepee dance every day? Oh, well, I'll have to see it if you want  to. The peepee dance. I love the peepee dance that the kids do. I got to go. I got to go.  All right, FU to your third graders and the kindergarten class. That's sick. Hey, what's 
[07:00]
 the worst thing one of those little bastards did to ruin your day? Talking all day. No,  nothing like crapping in their pants or anything? No, no, no, no. You guys don't bring extra  underwear to class for the kid that pees and stuff? Yes, they do. I'm not getting an extra  set. She doesn't consider that bad, though. Talking is worse than kids wetting themselves.  You know, I should call out a girl that I went to school with. This girl, Rosemary. I  won't use her last name because she's going to be mortified, but she was the one growing 
[07:30]
 up that peed her pants and the teacher always had extra underwear for her. And what grade  was this up? Um, man, at grammar school. And you remember this? Yeah. See how that follows  you? You know why I remember it? Because it was just a huge puddle under her desk. Yeah,  yeah. You know? All of a sudden you just heard, like, running water. Hey, what's the... Oh,  my God, she's peeing. And kids are just brutal. We're all laughing. Yeah. And the teacher  brings her down the hall and gives her fresh underwear and she came back into class. But 
[08:00]
 the problem was she was the same girl that struck out a kickball, by the way. Did the  poor janitor have to come in with the kitty litter stuff and throw it down? Yeah. Like  puke patrol. Oh, boy. What a job. The problem is, though, you know, in my neighborhood in,  you know, Huntington area, we went to grammar school and went all the way to high school  together. So no one forgot that she was the one that peed her pants in grammar school.  You had to move out of the neighborhood to shake that reputation. You can see that the  kid that threw up in school, that always happened to remember. Did Ralph was the kid that threw 
[08:30]
 up? No. No, see, you need the teachers to make them aware that they can't make fun of  everybody. Everybody does it. All right. Well, thank you for your FU. Thank you. All right.  Bye. Fortunately, I had a more compassionate third grade teacher than that lady. You know,  this is, oh, honey, come here, put your head on the table. And it was funny. To this day,  I can't eat a ring ding. Is that what happened? I had a ring ding for the first time back  when they were like the size of a plate. Yeah. You know, downsizing became fashionable and 
[09:00]
 I ate the whole thing. It tasted pretty good. No problem. Look down. Feeling, you know,  milk wasn't warm was cold milk. I must have a stomach virus or something because it just  came up and it was like Lake Erie. It was huge. It was really big. And the guy came  sawdust. I'm there with my head on the table. Just horrible. That's followed you though.  Come get me. I'm so sick. The kid that puked. All right. You know, they were pretty cool. 
[09:30]
 I didn't hear about it much after that. Believe me, they were talking behind your back. Most  likely. They were talking to my face though. All right. Well, FU Friday is off to a good  start. Yeah. I think we're going to talk a lot today. Screw the music. Well, we got Louis  Black coming in for he's still suck up an hour at least. Oh yeah. We've already sucked  up 20 minutes here. We're going to talk a lot today. The Rock of New York, 1027W, any  W sound garden black hole son. It's hope being Anthony. It's FU Friday. We're in a good mood 
[10:00]
 here and of another work week upon us or almost upon us, I should say. And lots of great stuff  coming in from the listeners already, man. Joe from North Bergen. We were talking about  like fellow classmates from your past that did some really stupid like puking class or  pee in their pants or whatever it was. I remember high school. But whatever it was, it's something  that happened in grammar school and it just stays with that person forever. No matter 
[10:30]
 if they grew up to be an honor student or whatever, they still remember that person  as the person that puked in fourth grade or whatever. Well, Joe writes, well, in ninth  grade this chick was wearing white pants, has her period and isn't prepared. We all  saw the stain and it stuck with her for four years. Oh, what they call her. Probably red  stain. Yeah. Hey, red stain. That's terrible. Yeah. Well, we also got a fax here from Andrew, 
[11:00]
 the angry met fan. Oh no, come on. No, because I know where this is going. Well, the faithful  listeners know who Andrew the angry met fan is. Andrew for some reason hated Joe DiMaggio.  Correct. Yeah. He couldn't wait for Joe D to die. If you remember his past faxes. Well,  Andrew writes, Hey guys, F Joe Tory. Oh, all of the news is focused on his cancer stricken  ass and now I can't gloat in the glory of Joe DiMaggio's death. Oh, come on. Andrew 
[11:30]
 the angry met fan. I want to say that he is not at all indicative of Mets fans. You  know, I don't think he is, is voicing the opinion of, of many Mets fans. He has terrible  voice in his opinion. Anthony, he is angry. John from Jersey, dear ONA, a big F you to  the butthole who broke into my storage closet and stole my tools. Now, now I have to spend  all weekend going through security tape to find you. And when I do, I will break my 
[12:00]
 foot in your ass. Break my foot in your ass. He's passed, man. I saw that footage of the  guy stealing the beanie babies in center port. Yeah. That's pretty funny. He has a little  jacket on and he's just loading up on beanie babies. That has become a big story. Everyone's  showing the video. Yeah. That's in our neck of the woods where we kind of live. Yeah.  I can't go over there and get pizza all the time. And the guy, the guy has a lot of beanie  babies over there and, and, but you can rob beanie babies. Well, they're, they get a good 
[12:30]
 price on the street. They got a good price. Baby babies, baby babies. I think I, it's a  little too much as being made of these things. It's true. You turn on the home shopping channel,  there's two burly men who I remember doing a lot of the baseball card things. Here it  is. Mark McGuire, rookie card. Look at this. Only $6,000. You know, you can sell this for  10 the second it comes to you in the mail. And that was beanie babies. Look at this. 
[13:00]
 We got fuzzy wuzzy. Look at fuzzy wuzzy. Fuzzy wuzzy just on my watch two minutes ago was  going for $80,000. Right now, $123,000 and you get princess and coochie-woochie and coochie-coo.  The big burly guys selling stuff, little animals. Those beanie babies are going to be worth  nothing in a few years. I know. It's all hype. You guys don't understand. You're loading  up on these worthless things. Look at this one. Fluffy oogie woogies. Fluffy snuggle 
[13:30]
 loggles. $8,000. Those beanie babies cost less than a dollar to make. Well, aren't they  made in Thailand? Yeah. The beads in them are cheap. There's some little kid that you're  sending 25 cents a month to feed his village, stitching these little things together. And  I hear they're $8,000. Beanie babies. Yeah, I got a great email that I got to read. Remember  yesterday we were asking for all the faithful listeners to send us a little feedback on 
[14:00]
 the show because we've been here nine months and we want to really get a feel for what  you guys have been digging about the show. As a matter of fact, you could do that through  the W.A.W. website. We set up a nice section, made it easy for you. But this guy writes  opiate Anthony as a faithful listener. It's hard for me to imagine that anyone out there  has just started listened to your show. I don't know what I would have done for all  of these years without you guys to make me laugh in the afternoons. I first tuned in  in the mid sixties when he started playing tunes from that new long haired band from 
[14:30]
 England. I think they were called the Beatles or flies or something like that. I don't know  how I ever would have made it through the Kennedy assassinations without your hilarious  bits and Anthony's Ted Kenny impressions. The sixties, huh? And all of the Nixon bits  made the Vietnam War just a little more bearable. I even stayed with you guys during Opie's  disco phase with those leisure suits and sideburns. The eighties were a lot of fun too. I'm sure  glad Anthony made it through the cocaine thing he was on and went into rehab. His Reagan 
[15:00]
 bits always made me crack up and when he parachuted onto the field at Shager in the  World Series, I laughed my ass off. I remember that. Go Mets. Now here in the nineties, it's  good to see that you both still rock. I'm sure it's not easy getting around with those  walkers with the handbrakes. Anyway, I just want to let you know how long I've been listening  and want to say you're doing a great job making us laugh. Keep playing the old bits along  with the new and keep rocking into the twenty first century. P.S. The bit about Krista McAuliffe 
[15:30]
 when the shuttle blew up in eighty four was hilarious. Oh my God. Stop. Oh, later guys.  Longtime listener. Al from Merrick. Al, you made me laugh. Thank you. Al, by the way, the  shuttle blew up in eighty six. Yeah, we had to look it up. We had a little argument. Eighty  four. I was still thinking it was eighty four. I was right. You were right. Of course I was.  Steve, through the fax line. Two one two nine five seven W. N. E. W. A big fat F. U. To  the F. In I. R. S. I just got my taxes done and I owe a thousand. Oh no, I owe thousands 
[16:00]
 thousand. We need tax reform now. I don't mind paying taxes, but this is absolutely  sick. Well, that's something we bitch about all the time. Taxes, but no one will do anything  about it. We're we're we're nice and calm and collected when things happen real slow  you know, that's why they take out your taxes every every week. They take your little income  tax out and then at the end of the year, if you have to pay even two thousand, you're 
[16:30]
 like, oh, OK, I'll do it. I'll send the check. You've already sent thousands in, but they  take it slow, slowly, slowly take it away. And then you try to spend the money they already  taxed and what do they do? They put a sales tax on it. And then you take your money that  they've taxed already and you put it in the bank to make some more money. And that's taxed.  Or you try to invest in the stock market and that's taxed. Say you do good. Yeah, they 
[17:00]
 even tax more. Yeah, they tax it even higher. Isn't this the reason we left the motherland?  We left England for like it was nothing. Right. The taxes were bearable and that is bloody  ridiculous. And that was the reason we left. You want me to pay an extra penny for a pound  of tea? I'm leaving. And these all wanker. And these scumbag politicians, they all come  out year after year and talk about tax breaks. You know, and they say some ridiculous figure. 
[17:30]
 And if you do the math, it sounds great. Like we're going to save the taxpayers millions  upon millions of dollars. And if you do the math correctly, it turns out you're saving  less than a dollar a year on taxes. Yeah, great. But they're claiming to do a real good  thing for you. It'll never change. It's just one of those things you have to deal with  in this country. No, nothing. No tax reform. And when you really get mad and hold up in  a shack up in Montana and start shooting at government officials, then they get pissed  at you. Yeah. Wacky guy. So there you have it. I'll be there in no time. I swear to God. 
[18:00]
 All right. You're hanging with Opie and Anthony. It's FU Friday. Kelly on the instant feedback  rights. This is pretty good. We're talking about those kids in school that you remember  for doing something stupid. Hey, guys, there was this chicken in freshman year of high  school who had huge hair sprayed hair one night one day while smoking in the girls room.  She borrowed someone's lighter, not realizing it had a huge flame lit all her hair on fire.  We frantically tried throwing water on her and putting it out for the rest of high school. 
[18:30]
 She was known as the flame. I was dangerous. The girls that used to do that, like spray  their hair up. We would call it the waterfall because they would take all the hair from  the back and brush it all forward and then spray the crap out of it. And the front would  just have this like waterfall piece of hair over it. And then from the front, it's like,  wow, look, a big head of hair. Yeah. They turn around from the back. It's just all pushed  up front. We call it the peacock. The peacock. Yeah. Yeah, I can see that. Yeah. Big peacock 
[19:00]
 feathers. I never got that look. No. Where it looks like a tidal wave in front. Yeah.  I never got that big waterfall over the head. I can name a few towns that that hairstyle  was popular. They sure they sure come to my face. Still is. Really? I haven't been down  there in a while, but. All right. Want to go to the phones real fast? Yeah, take a couple 
[19:30]
 of calls. The boss is gone. Let's just talk today. It's fun. Friday. Hi, N.E.W. Yeah,  I got a big F you. All right. Hit it. All right. I got a few going out for being put  on hold and then getting dropped. I have to wait for 10 minutes. Well, now you're live  in the air, man. What do you got? Also F you to that third grade teacher that was going  crazy. Yeah, she's got to relax. Oh my God. My kids are kinder going there. F you for  giving them all homework. All right. All right, buddy. You guys doing good. Thank you. Thank  you. All right. All right. No surprise. We hung up on that guy right at the first time. 
[20:00]
 Hi, N.E.W. What's up, guys? Hey, what's up? You're live on the air. This is Billy, the  happy Yankee fan. Can I give a big F you to Andrew, the angry med fan? Yeah, Andrew has  problems. We all know that by now. Yeah, a little bit. I hope his mom gets cancer. He  ain't dead yet. Whoa. There you go. Right back at you, baby. A little cancer war going  on. Andrew to 99. All right, bud. Thank you. Thank you. That is like the worst thing you  can wish on someone. That's horrible. But Andrew deserves it after his facts that he 
[20:30]
 sent in. Remember in the King of Comedy, one of the funniest scenes when Jerry Lewis, who  plays the talk show host, Jerry Langford, he's walking down the street and some ladies  by a pay phone and she goes, it's Jerry Langford. I love Jerry Langford. Hold on. Hold on. She  goes, Jerry, could you talk to my son-in-law? He's in the hospital. He's dying. Could you  please just talk to me? He's like, ma'am, I'm sorry. I got to be to work. She's like,  screw you then. I hope you get cancer. I hope you die of cancer. It's like the most awful 
[21:00]
 thing you can say to someone. That's another great movie, another King of Comedy. Rupert  Pupkin. Rupert Pupkin, everyone. I gave you my spot. My spot. Next to Jerry, I gave you  my best Jerry albums. N.E.W. No, they hung up. All right, one more here. Hi, N.E.W.  Oh, what a bean, Anthony. Listen, I want to give a big fat F you to Daryl Strawberry.  Wow. Why? All right. I don't know if you guys caught it on the news the other day. They  had Daryl on there and he's talking about how, oh, for a couple of weeks now I knew 
[21:30]
 that Joe Torrey had something wrong with him. I could feel it. I knew he had cancer. Like,  all of a sudden, because Daryl had a little cancer up his ass, he had some sixth sense  all of a sudden that he could find out. He knows by instinct everybody that has cancer.  He's like the cancer Kreskin? Yeah, exactly. He didn't know anything. All of a sudden now  he's the cancer guru on the team. Maybe he'll start doing coloscopies for everybody. Colonoscopy.  I don't know. You've got to watch out for his bag hanging out when he runs around the 
[22:00]
 bases this year. Oh, come on, man. I don't even have my bell. Wait a minute. Check, please.  Check, please. All right. That was a good one, huh, guys? That's a little wacky. All  right. I'm a wacky guy. Take it easy, guys. Take it easy. Bye-bye. People are heartless.  They're heartless today. It's Friday and it is FU Friday and people are just built  up. They're pent up. They're angry. They're letting their hair down. Hi, N-E-W. N-E-W, 
[22:30]
 yeah, what's up? Hey. Oh, I got a big FU for the magistrate at Staten Island Traffic Court.  Why? What'd you do? What I do? I went in there to plead not guilty to a ticket and the officer  was there and he said he couldn't remember exactly if he did follow me this long or this  long. So with that said, it was enough for the judge or with the magistrate to say, Hey,  you know, maybe you're innocent. All right. No, what he did was he looked back at my old  record. I'm 52 years old. He looked back at my old record from when I was like 25 and 
[23:00]
 28 and had some tickets. He looked at that and said, guilty. I mean, what a hump. That's  because he looked at that and stereotypes me immediately. All right. Well, we're glad  you were called with that. Are you really? Not really. No, not really. All right, man.  Are you trying to get it off my chest? Thank you. Thank you. All right. Actually, we got  distracted because our buddy Lewis Black walked in in the middle of that line. Lewis. Hello, 
[23:30]
 guys. How you doing? How are you, Lewis? Oh, just great. Good? Feeling good? Oh, yeah, it's  great. It's great. It's nice weather if it was, you know, like December 8th. Spring right  around the corner. Nothing I like better than getting out there and going, you know, like  it's nice. If you're a moose, this is really spectacular. If you got fur on your nuts,  you know, you'll love it. Yeah, let's run around. Boy, weekend. Let's party. I walked  around. And my apartment has no heat because it's March 1st. Yeah. Because they just, you  know, because now it's March. Yeah, they still turn it on. Of course. Because that's the 
[24:00]
 way the calendar works in this city. If a city on the planet and we have no control over  our heat, boy, are we smart. We've got this steam coming up. All I had to do was see that  machine and I'm started. They pointed the machine out and I went, oh, the Mogexpressa.  Oh, man. We'll get you a cup if you like. No, but I'm going to wait. I'm going to wait  until I start to flag. We're onto something new around here these days. People are now  taking pills. People are now taking speed. We all are. You guys have lost your grip. 
[24:30]
 Where are they selling it? It's supposedly natural, though. Oh, yeah, it's supposedly  natural. It's like all natural. Yeah, right. From the speed tree. Sure, right? We all took  it just to get ready for you today. What is it? Ginseng? Ginseng is my sister's name.  I don't know what it is. No, no, it's stackers. Stackers, too. Stackers, too. Yeah. Yeah, 
[25:00]
 we're just stacker, too. Yeah. Yeah, breaker five. Come on down the line. It's great. We're  flying. I'm buzzing. Oh, man, it's a delight out there. Yeah. You love Al Roker, don't  you? Oh, he's one of my favorites. What did he say it was going to be today? Seventy-two  probably. Seventy-two and then meanwhile, well, the scout was flashing pictures of dead people  that he's on earth. I want that investigated, too. That pig. Oh, yeah, boy. Who the heck 
[25:30]
 is you? What is Schmuckers thinking? Oh, yeah, boy, I will never touch that stuff. He gets  on there with the people 105 years young. Yeah, because they ate Schmuckers. Yeah, that's  right. And if I drink that ad for Madonna, I used to think why would they have Madonna  do an ad for Pepsi? Like when I'm drinking, I'm going to think I'm screwing her. Oh, boy,  give me another one. Let's do her again. It's idiotic. But that word, Scott, I want the 
[26:00]
 people. I want videos of him with the people. At least do something, you know? He can't  even jive. What is that? What is it? He announces people's birthdays. Exactly. It's like, you  know, you guys, why don't we do some of that here? It's the same picture, I'm convinced,  too. It is. Doesn't the old lady, it's the same one. She's sitting there mouth agape,  the big thick glasses. That's why I want him there in the room with him and I want  to hear him talk. Because officially, just because you can take a picture of him doesn't 
[26:30]
 mean they're alive. Okay? If that's what they're saying, we move on. But he's snappy. And I  love what they're into. Bertha is still into getting up every day. They have to mention  something. Bertha's hobbies are bowel movements, which she likes. Unfortunately, she says she  doesn't have enough bowel movements and saving things. She makes baggies, puts them away in  the fridge. She likes the pens. All right, well, Lewis Black is here. He's going to hang 
[27:00]
 with us for a while. We've got to take a quick break. You're here for the duration, like  it or not. You guys must have been desperate to think, call me. Oh, yeah. Of course I was.  I'm out of here. Our rooker was supposed to come in today. He canceled. All right, Anthony,  MapQuest.com. This is great. Here's the deal. You're driving around. You're lost. You're  pulling through a gas station. You find someone that you could ask for directions. And what  happens, Anthony? You're too split up. You take a left turn, but you're late. Then the 
[27:30]
 sun, you're going to see a fork. They ignore it. Go up past the fork and then over the  hill, turn around, come back and ask me again. Like what? And that's if you're lucky to find  someone that speaks English. Yeah. So MapQuest.com has made it really, really easy. If you need  directions to go anywhere, go on their website, MapQuest.com. And what you do is you put your  destination in, you put where you're starting from in, and then a map pops out with detailed 
[28:00]
 instructions how to get there. Text directions with mile markers between the turns you have  to make. So let's get a hypothetical situation. You want to go to grandma's house. You pop  in grandma's address. You pop in your address. It gives you street by street, mile by mile,  directions to grandma's. Exactly. Go up Elm Street, 1.3 miles. Turn right on Smith Street.  Like that precise. Love it. And then I use it. And then the map is cool too. I found it 
[28:30]
 fun just to go on there and try it out. So what I did is I put the address of where we  work and my home address to see what route they would give me. And it was the exact one  we do every day. Say you're stalking your favorite celebrity and you know their address,  but don't know how to get there. You have all the guns and ammo and knives in your trunk,  but no map. I use MapQuest. Yeah. It is really cool. She's a dirty girl. She'll pay and MapQuest  will help me. Help me get there. Make her pay. The Rock of New York, 1027, WNEW, Lenny 
[29:00]
 Kravitz and Fly Away. Jane's Addiction before that. It's FU Friday. It's Ope. It's Ann.  And it's Lewis Black. What's up Lewis? Oh you guys. We're talking about the commercials,  a lot of them for the medications that are out now. You've seen them all for the allergy  medication, baldness, Propecia. Propecia, that's my sister's name. And whatnot. And  the guy's talking about how wonderful it is, but then he's got to go into the disclaimer. 
[29:30]
 Yeah. You know? So he's like, hey, it'll cure baldness. Boots of a hair on the head of 95%  of the bald men. Side effects, maybe internal bleeding. Your penis falls off. It's unbelievable.  Call now. Yeah, because I read that he was doing this thing yesterday. And this is a  product. If the pill is broken, a pregnant woman cannot touch the thing. Oh my God, it's  like kryptonite. Yeah, because it'll cause a big, wide-headed baby to be bald. Just  a big jumbo one. And just the head, your little tiny feet. But what kind of a product is that 
[30:00]
 that you go, okay, what are men thinking? Exactly. I mean if it causes that, if you  just touch it, what could it be doing over time to you, you schmucks? Oh boy, I've got  to get a hair on my head. Go get some carpeting and stick it there, jackass. What is we have  lost our grip? Comes out like the monster in Alien. If a girl looks at the pill, don't 
[30:30]
 look at it. Shield your eyes, honey. Hi, N.E.W. How are you doing? All right, what's up? What  do you got today? Well, a big F.U. to the Tampax Corporation as far as talking about  commercials and bad taste. Why would a guy have an F.U. for tampons? Well, what they  did to my memory of Woodstock. Okay, I've seen this commercial. I haven't seen this  commercial. Go ahead, describe it. Well, they have nice shots of bands and people up there  having a good time in the whole nine yards. And right at the tail end of it, they say 
[31:00]
 Tampax. They come on the screen and at least they say Tampax was there. No, it wasn't.  Back then we didn't use Tampax, man. Yeah, well, I mean, of the 45 billion people that  went to Woodstock, I'm sure they could figure out that it probably was there anyway. But  I mean, I've seen that commercial. They show everyone grooving around and dancing. You 
[31:30]
 don't really know what it is at first. And then it's like, oh, Tampax was here. They're  going to destroy every one of my memories. They get their hands on it. They're just going  to do it to everything. Yeah. You know, you just see the World Series. The Mets win it.  86 or the Yankees win. Tampax was here. You know, the beaches at Normandy. Tampax was  here. We didn't use Tampax back then, though. We didn't do candy wipes. Whatever was available.  Don't take the brown tampon. Come on, wavy gravy. Come on, right? Don't take the brown 
[32:00]
 tampon, man. That's funny. So what's up, Louis? What do you want to get off your chest today?  Well, did you, uh, that Monica Lewinsky thing. Oh, that whole thing. Well, you know, I happened  to, here's what's wrong with it, I finally realized. Things have gotten so bad that they  actually had me come on TV to discuss it. So that means that there is, I started thinking 
[32:30]
 about this. This is what, this is why this, that we're in the state we're in. It's 24  hours of CNN news. It's 24 hours of Fox network news. It's MSNBC giving you 24 hours of news.  Combine that with all of the other, you know, the regular news, you know, the news that  we're getting anyway. The Bloomberg group or whatever, those schmucks who run those little  bands going, things are happening. Watch out. It's like 23 down the screen. Exactly. That  group. So you've got basically 162 hours in a 24 hour day of news. So they called me in 
[33:00]
 as an expert. Like what kind of expert? Political expert. I'm a political satirist. Okay. You  know, when they gave you a title, I've got a title as opposed to, you know, Schmucky the  Clown, which is a preferable one. And I'm on with Dr. Joyce Brothers, which, you know,  and it's, and you think, you know, you, you know, the hard thing is, is, you know, you  think, God, I'd like to get on with that person and just hit him in the face. I can't wait  to get near Joyce Brothers. I can give her a quick pop, but she's like, all of a sudden 
[33:30]
 I'm with Joyce Brothers. She's, you know, she's a very reasonable woman who's basically  got this deal going. And she was telling me, you know, you're sitting there going, well,  yeah, you're right. She's right. You're right. You couldn't even, you couldn't even bash  her upset because there was another punch there. And he ended up, I admit, you know,  since I couldn't get mad at her, now this guy's got to take my anger. It's the first  time I've ever, you know, in those Springer shows or they, they, they, the kid puts his  hand up to be like, I can't hear you. I'm listening to the jackass not knowing that  sound actually travels around. But I'm doing this to this guy. I'm thinking, oh, this is 
[34:00]
 why I can't be on these shows. I'm acting like a nine year old. No, I can't hear.  Singers in the years, la la la la la. I am not listening to you. Oh man. It was, it was  just, it was his, you know, I just saw as a result, you know, because they invited me  on this thing. Now I had to watch the, that, that, that, that two hours of hell. That trash  interview. Oh my God. Talk about, she's going to be that if you're wondering who  Sarah buses, it's Monica Lewis. You know that you're going to be at the mouth of hell 
[34:30]
 when she's sitting there next to the next to the dog. How are you doing? Come on down.  What? And Barbara Walters, the word that's the fastest watching that interview is the  fastest the word douchebags. I rarely, I rarely use it. And I, and it was the first  time I left. I'm sitting there going, wow, is she a douchebag? I'm like six seconds  into it. I'm thinking, Oh my God, that quick. Oh yeah, boy. And then there's big time.  And then they're doing this thing, you know, and then in between she's doing that pontificating, 
[35:00]
 you know, and then Monica, this was the day, February 9th, when Monica had a little bit  of cramp in her stomach. Yeah. Yeah. And wiped herself. She just, she just, she just, she  had diarrhea and wiped herself. She's really, it's the president doctor. What does the matter  with you? She's recapping. Yeah. We don't know the story already. 3000 ways from every  detail. Oh man. And then this girl, and she's just, I thought she expanded during the interview.  I thought she was getting larger. We thought, we thought she was hot. You guys need a break. 
[35:30]
 You guys need a break. You need a vacation. That's a stress related, that's almost a stress  related injury. I was looking at her mouth. We don't know. And they really had it done  up where it was glistening the entire interview. It was the best. No dry mouth. Her teeth,  it was just covered with a constant lubricant. Something I'm sure she's not unfamiliar with.  I mean, for the interview, it looks like they just rubbed Vaseline all over her orifice. 
[36:00]
 I'm sure they did. Oh my God. I just can't believe you guys were attracted. I can't come  back here. Just something about her. That big cellulite ass. I want to get in that ass.  Why not? Why not for a goof? Well, you know, the next guy that's with her is going to be,  get to the point where she's ready to perform the act that she is so famous for. And he's 
[36:30]
 just going to be a guy and think, here it is, it's the Lewinsky. I'm getting the presidential  hummer. It's got to be something. It's unbelievable. And the thing watching it, I thought, how  do people do drugs anymore? Why would you do drugs when this is on? How would a drug  help you? The thing is, out of control as it is, it would be, how would pot help? Just 
[37:00]
 slow it down and make it insufferable. And then you see her and you think, God, I need  to eat something too. I can eat her. It's just, it's law. And she's going on and on  and on. And I thought, ultimately there's no context to put this in. There's no context.  You know what I mean? It's like, how do we frame this? It's bigger than what we eat.  We can't find a context. I can't. I think if you do find a context for it, you're psychotic. 
[37:30]
 That's when you know you're psychotic. One of the guys yesterday came trying to find a  context for it. I wanted to, you know, during the thing, I was going, no, you can't. There's  no context. If we go there, then we'll snap. The next thing I know, I'll be in a hospital  robe. Unbelievable. What will we tell the children in history books? How will they write  it? Hey, man, what do you got?  I've been on hold for long. I was shaking inside. I've never been on the air, but anyway,  hi. Hi, what's up? I have a grandma school story. Oh, you do? I went to a grandma school 
[38:00]
 in Brooklyn with the nuns and I had a girlfriend use the master bank all the time in the classroom.  In the classroom? Right in the classroom. You turn around and keep going at it, right?  Anyway, the nuns told me to. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,  whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,  whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,  whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,  whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,  whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,  whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,  whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,  Whoa, whoa, whoa,  Whoa,  Whoa,  Whoa,  Whoa,  Whoa,  Whoa,  Whoa,  Whoa,  Whoa, 
[38:30]
 Whoa,  Whoa,  Whoa,  Whoa,  Whoa,  Whoa,  Whoa,  Whoa,  Whoa, 
[39:00]
 Whoa,  Whoa,  Whoa,  How did that start?  You just all of a sudden went, �Whoo, hey, that kind of got perky.�  That's it.  It's not getting perky.  But I just wanted to tell you about Susan.  She was really a nice girl. 
[39:30]
 How old did you lose your virginity?  You must have been a young starter then.  It's a sad story.  I married the boy next door and I was 15 actually.  That was Charlie Manson.  So I married him.  And chopped his head off.  I married him for 14 miserable years.  And meanwhile it's FU Friday.  I'd like to send one out to him.  Perfect.  Still holding on to that bitterness.  I love it.  No, only because he's got two beautiful teenage daughters and he doesn't even see them. 
[40:00]
 So he's deserving of it.  Well thanks for turning me on.  That was a great story.  Did I shake the bed?  I am so glad that I got through.  I love you guys.  I listen to you every day.  And I got a guy here at work who tells him I'm going to go straight to hell.  Hey, thanks Roxanne.  All right, bye.  All right.  My goodness.  True Confessions Friday.  That's fabulous.  Catholic school, the little diddling going on.  That girl is...  I'm surprised I didn't go out with Susan.  She didn't say if the nun was hitting her hand with the ruler while she was still working  her hand. 
[40:30]
 I know.  That's how you finish off.  The nun's like...  Oh yeah!  Yeah!  Faster!  Use the yardstick!  Boy oh boy can you.  That girl is going to be damaged.  What do you tell the shrink?  Well, you know, really my problem all stemmed from the fact that I had my finger in my woohoo  and the nun would come and hit me.  If you could just spank my bottom and I could say, sorry mom, then I think it would clear  up.  What do you do to get through that?  How do you get that out of your head? 
[41:00]
 I don't know.  You know, because you know how the Catholic school classrooms are all made up.  They've got religious icons all over the place.  So now every time you see one you're going to...  Oh look, it's the crucifix.  Man oh man.  The Rock of New York 1027WNEW.  You're hanging with Opie and Anthony and our pal Lewis Black from...  Whoa!  I didn't want to play that yet.  Okay.  Sorry about that.  From the Daily Show.  I thought they were going to be applauding instead.  It's the mouth of hell. 
[41:30]
 Well, it's a bit that...  Well, it's not a bit, it's really him I guess.  Oh, of course it is.  Yeah.  Oh, it's the babe, yeah.  People are requesting it.  We got a caller earlier this week Lewis from Babe Ruth.  Babe Ruth from hell.  Excellent.  We have caller ID here and the babe called us.  Came up hell on the caller ID.  Yeah, you know the babe.  Obviously he would have wound up in hell because womanizer, drinker, heavy smoker. 
[42:00]
 Actually got throat cancer later in life.  I love that little clip of him at Yankee Stadium talking to the kids.  And babe, boy.  Can't we remember our heroes like they were?  Do we have to hear that clip?  But yeah, we got in touch with him from hell where he's coaching a little league team.  Oh man.  Yes.  Would you like to hear more?  He's better.  He's better. 
[42:30]
 I'd love to hear that.  I want to meet somebody.  Yo, babe!  How you doing?  It's Babe Ruth live from hell everyone.  How you doing?  You got any whores there for me?  You alright babe?  Yeah, I'm in hell.  How alright could I be?  They got me coaching a little league team down here.  You're coaching little league in hell?  Well, fuckers can't even play. 
[43:00]
 Or drink.  They're not even interested in the whores like I was.  By the time I was six, I was knocked out left and right.  A bottle of pooch in one head.  This shit has been around since the other.  They invented the voice box just for me.  Yes, I know that.  The electric voice box. 
[43:30]
 It was actually an accident.  What do you mean?  Well, some chick I was with was using a dildo.  And I accidentally went down on her and realized I could talk.  Ron, you little fuck, hit the ball!  Jesus, Gert.  He's better, he's better, he's better.  Fuck you!  Hey babe, have you seen your pal Lou Gehrig down there in hell? 
[44:00]
 No, that pussy was a good guy.  He went up to heaven.  He did, huh?  Yeah.  He died of that Lou Gehrig disease, you know.  Yeah.  He's one of the odds of that.  And I take a little prick.  And we're going to get together with Billy Martin and Michael Kennedy tonight for happy hour.  Billy's driving.  Billy's driving.  You should see Michael's face.  It looks like my line. 
[44:30]
 Jesus.  Yeah, it looks like.  Whoa, whoa, what's wrong babe?  Babe!  I got spilled the beer in my voice box.  My wife's going to kill me.  Hey babe, you're married?  I did say I was in hell, you know.  Babe, babe, babe, babe!  Oh, there he goes, Babe Ruth everyone. 
[45:00]
 Oh, little harsh.  Oh man, oh man.  And we wish Joe Torre all the best in his battle with the big C.  Yeah, of course we do.  Yeah, Babe Ruth, he loves us.  Oh man, I'm glad he called you guys.  After all these years, he contacts us.  And to think that that's how the voice box got invented.  Sometimes it's a fluke. 
[45:30]
 You think George Washington Carver was looking for peanut oil when he was screwing around with peanuts?  No, it was a new type of butt plug.  And all of a sudden he noticed they were self-lubricating.  Bingo, peanut oil.  Most big inventions of the 20th century are purely accidental.  Oh man.  Of course, this is our own version of the view I guess.  Oh yeah.  Wow.  That really cleared up a few problems I had. 
[46:00]
 Glad we could help.  That really is.  I can't wait to see them.  Where do we go from there, you know?  Really, I don't even know.  I'm like, I am tuckered out.  Oh man.  What do you say now?  High and their roses will be coming out soon and they'll be blooming somewhere down the  boat.  I doubt it though.  It's like eight degrees today.  By August it should be about minus 172. 
[46:30]
 I have to reevaluate everything I thought about the weather.  I thought it was really going to be hot in August.  I think about 170 the other way.  But apparently we're going to flip back.  There'll be a big iceberg coming down.  A glacier again.  Exactly.  I can't wait for the glacial phase again.  It seems like you have a problem with Al Roker, Louis.  Well, Al Roker makes a million five a year and now they're bidding on him.  Other stations apparently think that this is an important voice.  That somehow America is locked into this guy.  I don't know what the deal is. 
[47:00]
 My feeling is if you wake up and you turn on the TV and you find that you're happy because  Al Roker is happy, I'm going to say this.  Kill yourself.  Okay?  As a matter of fact, you're driving the car and that's the way you think.  Just drive it off the road.  Don't take anybody else with you.  Or if you want wait until you get home and just leisurely in the tub, turn on a radio and drop it in with you.  It's kind of fun.  You can put us on or something soothing if you like. 
[47:30]
 But he makes a million five a year and he doesn't know anything about the weather.  We had three years ago a blizzard.  We had 36 inches of snow.  Al Roker predicted his prediction six hours before a blizzard, which by the way is some sort of emergency.  He predicted four to 12 inches and giving him the benefit of the doubt, he's two feet off.  Okay?  That's not even close.  You can actually get some sort of...  If you were a roofer and you built a roof and it was two feet off, you'd still be in prison now. 
[48:00]
 Okay?  It's just insane.  I used to come home from when he was just doing the news.  Now it's like the nation.  He's disturbing.  But I used to come home and it would be like 60 out in sunny and he'd say it was 58 in raining.  And I'd go back outside to check.  He is not a meteorologist.  But doesn't he claim to be? 
[48:30]
 I just think he's Al Roker goofball.  I don't think he's the only one.  Al Roker goofball.  Well he has the Doppler 5000 though.  I could punch it up on my laptop.  They talk about the Doppler 5000.  Yeah, but I think, and I also think he got away, you cannot be a weatherman unless you're standing in front of the map.  That's part of the deal.  You have to stand in front of the map.  Don't tell me anything because I need proof for later on.  He stands in front of rubes with signs high from Kentucky.  Well actually I think for a million five, any one of us could do the weather. 
[49:00]
 And we could do it with a gorilla screwing us.  Right in the butt.  Right in the buddy butt butt.  And we'd be fine.  And we'd be happy to see the gorilla.  We'd be like, hey Simba, how you doing?  Oh we got a big coal front coming in.  Oh boy, that's something isn't it?  Slow down Simba.  A million five.  A million five.  Everybody would be happy.  We'd make a start in another country.  I'm sure I would.  And I'd share my shame with Simba.  We would go there together.  The gorilla and his friends.  I don't care.  Go to the islands and see Lou Black and Simba. 
[49:30]
 This is too much fun.  I'm enjoying myself today.  Sure.  But all weathermen are idiots anyway.  It's an unbelievable.  Meteorologist in English means liar.  Well how about this?  Channel 5 weather girl.  Julie Golden.  You ever see her on the Fox TV show Good Day New York?  Yeah.  She does the little weather thing.  She got in a little accident and arrested for drunk driving.  Oh man, are they going to take away her car?  No, they're not taking away her car because there was someone else's car. 
[50:00]
 Oh that's good.  Yeah.  Good for her.  That's always good to take someone else's car.  When you're drunk and there's the solution to it.  Someone else's car.  Take another person's car.  But look at the time of this.  1.30 in the afternoon.  Well you know sometimes it's that early morning drink is really what helps.  I think she needs it to tell the weather.  Exactly.  She's got liquored up and she's pounding them down.  That's unbelievable.  Is she a morning weather girl?  Yeah.  Oh then that explains it. 
[50:30]
 She was just going home to sleep.  Sleep it off.  Unbelievable.  And there's a low pressure system coming down from Canada.  Oh it's going to be colder than a witch's teeth.  I guess it's time for another break unfortunately.  Wow, look at how quickly time goes.  We're refusing to play music.  All right Anthony, stacker two.  Stacker two, Opie.  Everybody is taking this around NEW.  Yes.  Everybody. 
[51:00]
 We're drifting through the hallways now.  Well we had to prepare for Lewis Black today.  He's a little high strung as our listeners know by now.  So I figured I needed to take some of this stuff to get on his level today.  It's an energy booster, big time.  Yeah, you took this yesterday.  I'm up to three days on this stuff.  Three days now?  Yeah.  And how are you feeling?  He weighs 32 pounds.  I know, he turned sideways.  He stuck his tongue out.  He was a zipper.  I weighed 32 pounds and everything on me itches.  But I feel great, man. 
[51:30]
 Yeah, I see you.  You have more energy than you normally do.  I'm noticing this.  I'm always looking for more energy, Anthony.  Hope's usually tired and usually after the show he's like,  Man, I'm pretty exhausted.  But stacker two, he's been taking this and now what would you do?  You climbed the side of the World Trade Center after the show.  After the show he went to the World Trade Center and climbed the side.  Well, I figured if George Willey could do it, I could do it too.  You could do it too. 
[52:00]
 And this stuff...  Jumping across between the two is a bit much.  Well, I figured I could make it.  It's stacker two, it's an energy boost and it also burns fat.  Oh, yeah.  And you can get this stuff within two days because the company's right there in Jersey.  So if you need a fix, they'll get it to you, man.  You'll be firmer than Joe D after this.  I swear to God.  If you want this stuff, give him a call, 1-800-LIGHTLINE.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-LINE. 
[52:30]
 Order today and there's a money back guarantee.  If you get the stuff and it doesn't work for you, they'll give you your money back.  And you'll actually be able to run the product back there in under two minutes.  But you won't want to, believe me.  Yeah, stacker two, give him a call right now.  As opposed to stacker one.  We've gone to stacker two.  I don't want to see what stacker three is all about.  You take it, your head explodes.  Stacker two, 1-800-LIGHTLINE. 
[53:00]
 I haven't slept for three days now.  It's exceptional.  That's just a joke, of course.  Wow.  You like that?  We love it.  Isn't that good?  It's unbelievable.  Yeah, stacker two.  That's what we call a stacker two.  We're all getting back rows in the studio right now.  1027W, the Rock of New York, Antony and Louis Black.  And we're back on the air. 
[53:30]
 That was great.  Louis is getting a back massage and Mike is right in front of his face.  We're trying to do a spot and he's, oh.  There's something about a good back rub that just makes you grunt incredibly.  It makes you grunt and groan like you're in heat.  It really does it for you.  That and a little stacker two.  I am set for life.  Sometimes you just can't keep it in you.  That reminds me of when you're trying to be quiet during sexual activity. 
[54:00]
 You ever in a situation, dorm room, maybe you're the person you share the dorm with  or you're camping or ski-lodging, you have a girl with you and you're just ripped and you're trying to have sex  but you can't make noise?  You ever try that little Rubik's Cube?  I end up barking.  I think there's a dog in the room. 
[54:30]
 That usually throws them off.  Well the deal is you can't make a lot of noise because you've got people sleeping, what, within a fort?  Yeah, the sleeping bags all over the place.  If you're camping or you're dorming, you've got your roommate right next to you, something, you tend to make that noise where you're...  That little...  I think I heard somebody. 
[55:00]
 Okay.  That's a tough one, man, trying something.  Alone.  This is our show.  Yeah, there you go.  What else you got, Louis?  What else do I got?  I don't even know.  That back rub, I think it got rid of every one of my thoughts.  It tends to do that. 
[55:30]
 She is good.  She knows how to give a good back rub.  But now I've got a boner.  I'm just trying to think what else is in the news.  The other pig of the week is George Stephanopoulos.  Here's a guy who, talk about it, a toady to the tenth power.  Could not get his nose far enough up the cracks of those two's ass.  And now we've got to go, oh boy, this is what they're like. 
[56:00]
 What is he?  This is what they're like?  Who do you like, you little pig?  I mean, come on.  You're the one who basically dropped these two insufferable idiots on us.  And now you're acting like you had no part in it, jackass?  Yeah, all of a sudden now he's just working as a correspondent.  And he's got all the insight on these people.  And now he's spilling about how horrible they are.  How horrible.  What was the thing?  Because I missed it.  He got him elected.  He got him elected.  But somebody was telling me the other day that either, what was it, he was on, does he claim that being on Prozac, 
[56:30]
 or that he was that it?  Zoloft or something.  Zoloft, because of the stress of the job.  That Clinton put him on this and that that was the reason he really didn't know what was going on.  What kind of Clinton put him on this?  Was that it?  Clinton's always trying to put something in people's mouths.  I don't know what it is.  Drugs, swines, whatever.  But you know, and then here's the difference, you see that movie, The War Room, with him and Carville, that other pigorama.  Oh man.  And I'm watching that and everybody's, you know, it's an interesting film to watch. 
[57:00]
 But the whole time I'm watching them going, this is disgusting.  I mean, it's like they're selling a product.  They should have worked for Stacker too instead of you two idiots.  You know?  Because they're up there, you know, and then we got Bill Clinton.  They don't even treat him like he's a human being.  We're going to take him out.  We're going to take him.  We're going to go through Jersey.  Right, right.  You know, it's like they've got a farm animal that they're going to show at the fair.  Pretty much do.  And he's ready to stud. 
[57:30]
 And then to have this kind of nonsense, you know, it's beyond, it's just, it irks me to the end.  I just can't take him.  And then he married, and Carville marries that Mary Matlin.  And he and the other pig, you know, there's a pigasaurus.  Boy, isn't that fun to just watch them argue on national television.  And that's something, you know, that whatever product they're, whatever it is that they're selling together, I know that I actually, I think I firebombed it in the store.  It's like, no, you can't do that.  I don't want to hear these people.  I'd be like, I'm married.  And they both, they both come from the totally opposite points of view. 
[58:00]
 And neither point of view makes sense.  She's so Republican, you actually, I get hives thinking about her.  And he's so, he's so Democratic that he's, you know, you just want to, I'd rather have a plumber's helper up my butt, than to listen to him talk.  You could find his hair follicles in Clinton's ass.  Yeah, exactly.  All of his hair is up Clinton's butt.  It's amazing.  It's extraordinary to me.  It's just that these guys are doing this and then he comes out with the book. 
[58:30]
 And then he's like, why did ABC hire him?  What kind of a culture is this?  And then they're asking me to come on the air.  We have, I'm serious, we're in deep trouble.  You know why?  They've run through everybody as far as the Clinton thing goes.  So they're down to now us.  We're experts in the field now of cocky humor.  We've brought in the cocky humor.  No, poo poo humor is what Ted Koppel is.  Actually heard Ted Koppel.  Talking about the Grieve man there. 
[59:00]
 And he said, you know, you do that poo poo humor.  Did Ted just say poo poo humor?  Ted Koppel poo poo?  Poo poo humor.  The poo poo humor.  The news guys are out of their minds at this point.  They're trying so hard to put new twists on things.  Like you said, everyone's doing news now.  20,000 hours of news every day.  So they've got to find the unique angle that only they have.  It's supposed to just kind of like relating information. 
[59:30]
 Which should be nice.  Which is enough.  So now they're going to get you and Joyce Brothers.  Under the little panel.  The other thing is that I took LSD in me during my life.  Oh my God.  Leave.  In order to prepare me, basically, the reason people take LSD is you want to,  you tend to have every thought that's humanly possible.  And the fact that the president might get oral sex from a 21 year old never crossed my mind.  Ever.  Ever. 
[60:00]
 No matter how many hits you've taken.  Exactly.  No matter what.  The chair would turn into a snake.  But nobody, nothing prepared me for this.  And now I think we're just out of, now I think we've lost our minds.  I think we're completely adrift.  And I don't know if we're coming back.  I don't know if we're coming back.  All right.  Eat, drink and be married.  And the other thing is no matter what side you're on in this issue of the president,  you're wrong. 
[60:30]
 No matter what, you can take any side you want.  You're completely wrong.  That's true.  I don't care whose side you're on.  You can completely side with him.  And you're completely wrong on that.  What he did is disgusting.  But what about her?  Well, she's a little piggy too.  And then everybody kind of lines up.  And Hillary Lester, there's a role.  Do you feel sorry for Hillary?  No.  Jackie.  What's she doing?  You know, Joe, I was just lying in the post.  Well, you know, I wouldn't even sleep in the bed with him.  Get out of the house.  Please.  Oh, they're not going to come.  They're just going to come here?  Yeah.  I'm going to drag that dog and pony show to our audience. 
[61:00]
 We don't want.  We don't want.  I don't experience enough hell every day.  Yeah.  We thought it was going to be over after the next election.  But no.  They're bringing it on a local basis now.  Now we've got to get it up close and personal.  I know one way she can get back at daddy though. 
[61:30]
 Oh yeah.  Chelsea, if you're listening, come over here.  You're a dirty girl.  Yeah, we could get back at daddy together.  Yes, we can.  I'll teach you.  I got a big cigar right here.  Yeah, I'll teach him right. 
[62:00]
 He's been bad.  He neglected his daughter with a young girl.  I won't neglect you.  We'll get him back.  You get him back for being a bad daddy and I'll get him back for being a bad president.  Yeah.  It's the perverted Bob Ross everyone.  Yeah.  That's the Bob Ross voice.  Yeah, take a little Lizarine Crimson.  That's great.  Poor girl.  You're right.  Give her a ward. 
[62:30]
 It's over.  Should we take some phone calls?  Yeah, what are the people thinking?  See if anyone's listening to this crap.  No, they're not.  It's good.  It's a fact.  I.W.  I'd like to send out an F to my mom.  Oh, boy.  To your mom.  Is she hot?  No.  Okay.  No.  Because when I was squatting, I only got one... 
[63:00]
 You know, I thought the thalidomide was outlawed.  I only got one question wrong on my test and she not giving me the thing she promised to.  I'll get her on the phone.  What was that?  What was that?  What she promised you?  She promised me a deck of cards, which I really need.  Go to a store and steal it.  Come on, you're small enough nobody will notice.  Your mom won't get you a deck of cards?  What kind of cards?  Pokemon cards. 
[63:30]
 What cards?  Pokemon.  Pokemon.  Pokemon.  The little Japanese little...  Don't ask me how I know this.  I don't even want to look at you when you turn the cartoon on the other day.  You don't need Pokemon cards.  You need them like I need a hole in the head.  You think I work all day to make money to buy you cards?  All right, well, thanks for calling.  Is Yoshi going to be coming on?  What?  Can you see if Yoshi can come on the radio?  Yeah, Yoshi will be here later. 
[64:00]
 Okay.  All right, bye.  Bye.  All right, that's who I'm talking to.  You're doing George Stephanopoulos material into a six-year-old.  How about that Barney?  Damn him.  Hi, NAW.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  They got you to make it a cruel intention.  Oh, the new movie coming out?  Yeah, it's a good movie.  The beginning was all right.  There were sexy scenes.  A couple of them.  A really perverted movie.  Yeah.  Yeah, the guy dies at the end.  Which one dies? 
[64:30]
 Ryan Philippi.  The baggy little guy with the fuzzy head.  The real little head guy.  All right, so he dies and no one needs to see that.  Okay.  Just give away the end of the movie.  All right, thanks, man.  Well, that's what happens when you go out and you try to have a good time.  Yeah.  You know, they kill you at the end of the movie.  Well, we start something really nasty on our show.  We give away the ending to all the movies.  You guys.  With absolutely no forewarning that is coming.  It comes out of Babe Ruth from Hellbit.  You know, we had a guy, he got tape of it. 
[65:00]
 He stood up before Message in a Bottle and told the whole audience that Kevin Costner  dies at the end of the movie.  Did he really?  The audio is priceless.  Then you're running out of the theater before they kill him.  It happens, right?  That's unbelievable.  Yeah, yeah, pretty bad.  That's our new little wacky bit.  Well, no, Message in a Bottle.  What difference does it make if you know he dies?  90% of the people who are going to that movie read that idiotic book.  Who else would go see it?  It's all for good.  We also gave away the ending to Life is Beautiful, though.  We got a lot of heat for that. 
[65:30]
 Yeah, the Italian guy dies in the concentration camp.  Well, that was a tough stretch.  Hello, it's called the Holocaust.  Hello, America.  You gave away the ending.  Knock, knock, knock, knock.  Is anybody home?  They took the Jew away and they killed him.  Well, what do you think?  Oh, my God.  No, he went to a nicer place.  What's happening to your show, guys?  You're getting phone calls from four-year-olds.  You're talking about dropping asses.  Oh, my God.  So what do you got, Jimmy?  Nothing, just hanging out. 
[66:00]
 Oh, there you go.  Well, that'll contribute.  I've got good stations now.  I can't date this anymore.  You guys used to be the best, but I don't know.  You've got to give me something to listen to, you know?  Uh-oh.  Thanks a lot.  That's very sweet of you.  I'm really glad that I trundled my ass down here to talk.  You don't like the stories about LSD and kids?  No, I'm just saying.  I mean, that's your audience now.  No, not at all.  Oh, yeah.  You guys alienated everyone else, except for me.  All right, Jimmy.  And he's leaving.  Peace. 
[66:30]
 Hi, N-E-W.  N-E-W.  Hello?  Yeah, what's up, buddy?  Hi, it's Joe in New York.  How are you doing?  All right, Joe, what do you got?  I was just listening to you guys about your feeling about it.  Nothing happening with newscasts these days.  But I just want to ask you a quick question.  What do you feel about last week on our newscast about Monica Lewis's book,  not being able to be sold in Europe?  Why do you think that is?  I mean, Europe is really like a pretty much a, you know,  a society that's pretty, well, I don't know, perverse, 
[67:00]
 but they're pretty kinky.  So how can you think of a book not being sold over there?  Because they find it hard for people to translate.  They can't find anybody to translate.  There's nobody over there who knows English to Spanish.  It's unbelievable.  This is, everyone who does this kind of work died.  That's how I'd explain it.  What about you guys?  It's a good show, guys.  And, you know, that little kid, that little cop with the little kid,  I guess maybe he got the wrong number or something.  I don't know.  But you guys got a good show.  Hey, thanks. 
[67:30]
 All right, bye.  Bye.  Not much happening on the phones today.  No, not at all.  That was, well, a person calling up and saying,  we're doing a good job.  You guys, you didn't even, it's like I didn't kiss my ass.  What do you mean?  That was a good thing.  Get door-to-door driving directions to any ski area in the country.  Before you get in the car, get online and head straight to mapquest.com.  It's How to Get There.  Basically, it's...  1027WAW, the Rock in New York.  It's Opie and Anthony and Lewis Black.  If you're still listening to this train wreck, we call it Radio Show. 
[68:00]
 We are giving away tickets to see Collective Soul this weekend as well.  And we'll give a pair away to the 10th caller right now.  Yeah, but we're going to cheat like those guys.  Oh, God.  We're going to have exactly, wait until one of my friends calls.  Hey, we're giving away a trip.  We'll call it a contest.  212-757-1027 for the Collective Soul tickets.  All right?  Cool.  All right.  You're going to go out, you know, I love this thing that the lottery reaches like 33 million.  Yeah.  You know, and now we'll go out and get it.  You know, like before when it's 12, it's like, I don't really need that. 
[68:30]
 Chicken feed.  Who needs that?  But 33 and there are more ways to win.  Well, how can there be more ways to win, you schmucks?  There's one in a gazillion ways to win.  And it's never going to be us.  And that's the way it is.  And unless you're in a trailer or something.  Wow.  That's true.  Who wins it?  It's never anybody who's truly desperate.  Well, it's truly desperate on a certain level.  Well, it's always an old person that doesn't need the money anyway.  Yeah.  No, it's always somebody who says, yeah, I'll go back to my job.  Yeah, I know. 
[69:00]
 Yeah.  You're going to quit?  No, I like working at the light bulb factory.  It's like, you quit.  Why'd you play?  Yeah.  My life isn't going to change.  I like my old car.  I like my old job.  But why'd you play?  You moron.  Well, Lewis, we'd like to update you on some of the stuff that's been going on on our show.  Good.  In between your visits.  Well, we've got a new song we want to play for you.  Excellent.  This one's kind of getting rave reviews, but a couple of people don't like it.  A couple of people have complained.  Is that right?  Should we just play it for them? 
[69:30]
 This is supposed to be the Babe Ruth in Hell Creek.  Yeah.  Just glomming on.  I'm still waiting for the response on the Babe Ruth.  Now, this is becoming a fave of the Open Anthony audience.  So take a listen. 
[70:00]
 I'm going to play it for you.  I'm going to play it for you.  I'm going to play it for you.  I'm going to play it for you.  I'm going to play it for you.  I'm going to play it for you.  I'm going to play it for you.  I'm going to play it for you.  I'm going to play it for you.  I'm going to play it for you.  I'm going to play it for you.  I'm going to play it for you.  I'm going to play it for you.  I'm going to play it for you.  I'm going to play it for you.  I'm going to play it for you.  I'm going to play it for you.  I'm going to play it for you.  I'm going to play it for you.  I'm going to play it for you.

[85:30]
 I could useile a second.  Here, he'RE A BIG ROCKSTER, what are you doing hangin' out with mom?  I flew home for two days to see the show.  What kind of benefit show does your dad do?  What does he do?  He and his buddy from the 60s have a little singing group and they're going to do a show 
[86:00]
 for a scholarship fund.  Kind of a Peter, Paul and Mary type thing?  Exactly.  It's all making sense now.  It's all making sense.  See what the acid does to the offspring?  All right, Michigan.  Well for our listeners in Michigan, you can go to that.  I think I'm the only one.  Really?  I don't think they can pick it up out here.  Hey Stephen, can we talk to your mom? 
[86:30]
 No.  What do you mean no?  What are you insane?  Come on.  Are you crazy?  I want to say hi to mom.  You think I want to feed her the lions?  He's behind the music with Stephen Lynch.  You get to talk to his mom.  I know it's under your bed.  Does she keep your room exactly like it was when you left?  Yes it is.  All my old posters up on the walls.  Now what kind of posters do you have up on your wall right now?  I think I've got a Journey poster.  A couple Led Zeppelin black velvet posters. 
[87:00]
 Those are cool.  Black light.  You can turn on the black light and it glows.  That's pretty sad.  It's always good to come home.  So later on this month you're playing three nights at what, Caroline's?  Yes.  Awesome.  Yes, but actually what I wanted to get out today is I'm actually doing a benefit concert  tomorrow with a bunch of other comedians at the West Best Theater. 
[87:30]
 In Michigan?  No, that would be there in New York City.  I'll be back in time for us.  What time is that at?  It's at 9.30.  Tomorrow night?  Yes.  Okay.  And where is this place located?  I don't know the exact address, but you can call the West Best for details.  I was just kind of thrown into it, but it's going to be a good show I think. 
[88:00]
 It's for a worthy cause.  There are a few different charities that all the money is going to.  It's part of a week-long festival of St. Patrick's Day type events.  Look at you chip off the old block with your benefits.  Your dad's not in the Bay City Rollers, is he?  He's in Grand Funk.  We saw the behind the music Grand Funk on TV.  That was great.  That was a good one.  Actually, Question Mark and the Mysterians were from my hometown here in Saginaw, Michigan.  Really?  Remember the 96 Tears guy? 
[88:30]
 Of course.  In the hotbed of rock.  How about that?  Wow.  TV Wonder and Question Mark and the Mysterians.  Very nice.  That guy believes in aliens.  I learned that on Behind the Music.  And no one knows his real name still to this day.  So what is that, a small town you're in?  Yeah, it's pretty small.  So what are you doing with yourself?  I'm hanging with the folks.  My brother's here.  No bottles of 40 I guess.  Are you going to the local gin mill to talk about high school days and stuff? 
[89:00]
 I think that will be tonight.  Isn't that the worst?  They talk about that big play when they were like the tight end for the football team.  Right, all my friends were still here.  Yeah, they're still living it eight years later.  It's going to be pretty depressing.  Yeah, that's sad.  How's New York, man?  God, you got out.  Take me with you.  And I'm getting out again tomorrow.  All right.  Well, when are you coming in to do a few more songs, man?  Anytime.  I'll be back tomorrow, so maybe next week or something. 
[89:30]
 Yeah, that's fine.  We'll start putting some malt liquor.  All right, I will.  We'll start pumping the Carolines gigs later on this month.  Yeah, cool.  And you've got to do that song we heard at Carolines that we never heard before.  Okay.  A brand new one that he'll perform on our show next time he's in.  I'll do whatever ones you want me to do.  All right, Steven, so you're playing a benefit concert tomorrow.  You don't know how to get there.  You really don't know the name of the place.  No, I know the name of the place.  All right, the name again?  West Beth Theater.  All right, and that's at the West Beth Theater.  All right, so you're going to be playing a benefit concert tomorrow.  You're going to be playing a benefit concert tomorrow.  All right, and that's at 930 tomorrow night.

This is the type of show we like to do on FU Friday.  It's Opie and Anthony and whoever else will stop by the studio.  Bob Hope on the way. Is that true, Anthony?  Yeah, some kind of new Bob Hope doll.  All right.  Hopefully we'll hear from him next. 
[92:30]
 How you doing over there?  Oh, half a page.  The Rock in New York, 1027W, N.A.W.  That's local HN bound for the floor.  Off there as good as Dead CD.  First time we're playing that here on N.A.W.  On our show, anyway.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's FU Friday.  Things are going quite well.  Time's flying.  We're out of the box really fast today.  Man, time's cranking, man. It's already six. 
[93:00]
 That's amazing.  Look at this.  We've been a lot of talking today, by far.  Well, Anthony, you're right.  You see that ad?  Yeah. What is this, from TV Guide?  Yeah, I want to get one of these.  All right. In TV Guide, the insider,  after a career of playing for the troops,  Bob Hope is now available to really play.  The 95-year-old honorary veteran of the armed forces  has been immortalized as a collectible Hollywood hero, G.I. Joe Doll.  A G.I. Joe Doll.  And a spokesperson says we've heard how much he likes it. 
[93:30]
 Yeah, right.  Like, he's even talking at this point.  He's transparent now.  I didn't know they were making these specialty G.I. Joes.  They've been making them for years.  I used to buy them in the hobby shop.  It was called the Invisible Man.  Remember? You used to build the model with the insides.  He's translucent.  He had Hasbro's, but now collector's edition G.I. Joes.  And one of them is the Bob Hope Doll. 
[94:00]
 I can't imagine a lot of people going to rush out to get the Bob Hope G.I. Joe.  I checked one website, sold out.  Really?  People are buying these things.  They think they're, you know, collector's items.  Everything now is a collector's item.  Like the Beanie Babies!  You know, they think it's a...  The problem with the Beanie Babies, it sounds like it's a rare one,  but thousands upon thousands of people are buying them.  They've only made 800 billion of these fluffy The Bunnies!  Now you've got to hope that just about every one of them loses them. 
[94:30]
 Yeah.  Except for you, and then yours will be worth a lot of money.  Each one numbered!  Yeah, so everyone's collecting these things.  Now the Bob Hope Collector's Edition G.I. Joe.  Yeah.  Everyone's hopping on the collector's bandwagon.  Uh-oh.  He's making his way into the studio.  Hey, can someone help me over here?  He's taking his time.  I'm a little blind, you know.  Yeah, Kevin, move all the chairs and microphones out of Bob Hope's way here.  Yeah, I got to tell you, boy. Hey, how you doing?  Hey, Mr. Hope, how are you?  Hey, hey, what's up over there?  No, no, no, the microphone's over here. 
[95:00]
 Ow!  Hey, Bob!  Turn around, your microphone's right in front of you.  Hey, how about them cataracts, huh?  Boy, they're a bitch, let me tell you.  Yeah, they got my G.I. Joe Bob Hope doll coming out.  They wanted to put out a beanie Bob Hope.  Yeah, something gushy.  Going to call it a poopy Hope or something.  But no, G.I. Joe hopped on a bandwagon.  Made a G.I. Joe doll.  Here, look, I'll hold it up here.  See, the eyes are authentic cataract blood red. 
[95:30]
 So you tell it's a real, authentic Bob Hope G.I. Joe doll.  I see that, Mr. Hope.  Yeah, that's all. I got a couple of features.  This one's the Bob Hope with the arthritic grip.  Look, see, I press the button,  and it screams in pain and drops whatever it's holding.  Watch, watch.  Ow!  See that? Look at that. It's called the arthritic grip.  I guess it's the takeoff on the Kung Fu grip from years back, huh?  Yeah, say what?  Huh?  Who?  Yeah, I got to tell you, boy, I used to help the troops out in Vietnam. 
[96:00]
 That's why G.I. Joe's putting out a Bob Hope doll.  And I have some military experience over there.  Yeah, that's why they gave me the removable colostomy bag grenade.  You throw it like napalm and it explodes.  My colostomy bag and a detachable prostate grenade.  It looks like a pineapple.  Just like grenades. I used to call them a pineapple, remember?  That's what my prostate looks like.  I remember. 
[96:30]
 Each one hand-painted liver spots.  All over it. Look at me. I'm speckled.  Look like a cheetah.  Yeah, it's a cute little thing right there.  You get the whole Bob Hope collection.  Here's my wife, Dolores doll. Look at this one.  Let me take her pants up.  Look, see, dust in the crotch.  My wife, Dolores, so old she couldn't get wet snorkeling.  Ow!  And here, look, here's the Bing Crosby doll.  Man, we used to do those road films.  Me and Bing. Look, here it is. 
[97:00]
 Oh, wow, look at that.  Look, stiff as a board. Just like Bing.  Yeah, he's been dead, you know?  Arr!  Look at that. Here's my talking Bob Hope GI Joe doll.  Are you going to pull the string for us?  Yeah, don't pull the string.  Hey, how about a big hand for Bobby Burton?  Hey, look at that.  Oh, my eyes are bleeding.  See, here's a talking Bob Hope GI Joe doll.  Yeah.  Kutzy, kutzy, how about that chowder?  Arr!  See, it's all authentic claps of Bob Hope. 
[97:30]
 Be Bob Hope.  Hey, someone changed my colostomy bag. Sleuton.  How about that one?  See if I can pull it for a couple more.  Okay.  Oh, I love that Brooks Hill.  I don't need Viagra with that Brooks Hill.  Arr!  Are you sure you need Viagra just to take a leak?  Hey, who told you that, Dolores?  How about that? My eyes are bleeding.  Yeah, you said that already.  Can't see so good. 
[98:00]
 Hey, are you going to make another road film with Bing Crosby?  Yeah, on the road to the cemetery.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, he's dead. Arr!  I'll tell you, boy, it's embarrassing being this blind.  Yeah, one time I went down on Frank Sinatra's wig.  Thought it was Dolores. Arr!  Arr! My prostate hurts.  I don't want to talk in G.I. Joe, doll.  Pick up your G.I. Joe Bob Hope doll.  Yeah, we're all going to run out and get that Mr. Hope. 
[98:30]
 Hey, look, the Sammy Davis Jr. doll.  Look at that.  That's part of the collection.  Yeah, watch.  Where?  Watch, you pull the string, look.  His eye falls out.  Come on.  Look at that.  Look, it pops back in.  See how I pull the string?  Look, his eye fell out.  I tell you, another year, there's going to be a feature on mine.  Both eyes are going to pop right out of my head.  That's pretty large. 
[99:00]
 I got cataracts.  Can't see so good.  Yeah, you said that.  Arr! My eyes are blind.  All right.  Thank you. Thank you to the people at Hasbro.  Yes.  For putting me in a doll.
