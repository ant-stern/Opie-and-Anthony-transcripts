[02:00]
 they don't need to tell you what the weather was like today we already live  through it so we were cool footage of police shootings and chases and i don't  get a rise  fun stuff to watch i think they can easily just go here's the weather and  just show the five-day forecast and that's all you would really need to know  yes  that's how we stand on the issue but i read joe fisher in the rest of the half  the look important  throughout a breath running to the the the weather map and stuff i was just in  now we're looking at some computer models  of this storm

[03:00]
 by nude men about their penises  that was the show so after uh... rise war  we have we turn it in  and the phone rings at eleven twenty no one calls me eleven twenty night i'm  like it's got to be at the date so i pick up the phone and you're not even  talking like  i was wrong and that's dying well as a funny very funny yeah so we'll get into  that discussion a little later cuz we got some great uh... audio clips from  the show yeah bring to you guys just in case you missed it last night  whether stereotypes and 
[03:30]
 just uh... holding them up every time the i think a stereotype is going to be  knocked down because we're past it  they showed the the asian guys on this show the penis show  talking about their small penis and then they show the black guys one of which was  talking about how he's got a watch he doesn't in here  the girl these went yeah because he's huge  uh...  what about the guy with the thirteen-and-a-half-inch earth yeah  yes standing there completely new to hanging down to his knee practically  and he had such a big swarm that uh... other people have big swans want to show 
[04:00]
 them how big their darkened  it's like a whole thing that he get the as going on and he said he's never seen  one bigger because i guess his friends bragging say look man my body has the  biggest one in the united states or if you've got a brag about your friend  having a lot of it then you know how guys are you know then you'd you try to  get challenges and stuff and no one can beat this guy they even said i need to  go last night if uh... someone has a fifteen-inch or i don't want to see it  uh...  used that is kind of a bad show cuz i'm watching it with my wife and you don't 
[04:30]
 want it  you know i'm  have her see that  so who that's out there  hey look at what we look out there yeah but the old guy with the two-inch or  made us all feel good yeah yeah i worry about that and i was feeling pretty good  about myself about that guy the guy he's naked he's one fifty eight years old i  believe yeah completely naked well had short time  and he's smoking a tiny little almost like a white house cigar and that is  describing that his uh... swan is half the size of the cigar he's not in the  size 
[05:00]
 pathetic and we got some great audio that guy would play later on he was a sad  sort wasn't it and he told a story about uh... he was with this girl for the first  time he decided to go for it  and uh... she saw him naked and she starts laughing hysterically yeah  it's pretty funny pretty sad ralph you missed a good one last night i said no  about this at all out of curiosity uh...  big guy did talk about his sexual uh...  experiences at all  none of the guy would pass out if you ever tried to get an arrest  of what the rain on the runway 
[05:30]
 now you really talk about is more like  you know he he just likes to brag about any tells how much everyone that he's  got the thirteen and a half inches  and someone emailed us late the show yesterday and said that they know that  guy  it's a friend really so if that guy's listening please call us up and we get  on the show  and what about rick said in the  in the office earlier  because we all watched it so it would talk about the show  and uh...  there were some uh... real heinous guys on there you know  big fat guys and stuff  well i'm not paraplegic out in a wheelchair 
[06:00]
 yeah just couple masses  so rick says  he has got to watch in that show and uh...  you know what i want to have to have such skanky guys you know it  but when you even said it would be it would have been better if there was some  good-looking i mean i didn't say that in first good-looking i have a bad more  attractive and i don't know no i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't  know as well  i don't know  i want to explain his himself out of this one there is a very good here's a 
[06:30]
 little rick they're talking about ralph right right right right  so anyhow  my name is ralph and i don't know  now what i said  it was it was so  it was so disturbing to watch is cuz you know at least  you know they should use better looking guys could be right they used  were so  you know i don't know that i don't know again but does it matter saying well  yeah i think it's just naked guys and i want to watch on screen  i'm not thinking 
[07:00]
 how it could be better down the line where i think that i think you got a  wish you was high yeah yeah what do you want to get jib and dales model  with the huge units anyway i am saying with you there in his own hand i'm  saying because this makes sense to me  that if the guys were better looking you could look at their face and not worry  about going to a little bit  well yeah i mean i i don't have to look at the other matter i can't count your  comment you're going to there's no saving this one and i'm just saying  because  uh... let's face it the gap 
[07:30]
 one i was an asian guy i mean he had like long scraggly hair and he's good  and look at all what a mess this guy you know i don't know what i'm i said  bobby a looking guy with  and i don't think it to me i'm sitting watching a man jan  and i'm watching and it didn't occur to me  boy this would be better with some hot guy i don't know what you were really  thinking and i'm just thinking you would be it would be easier to do actually  all right now  if you're looking hot guys with a very huge unit of these guys are such a mess 
[08:00]
 so  i'm just saying i'm going to play with a little bit of a chicken that they are  really concerned with the female contingent  and i'm sitting next to my fiance she's like this is the only thing i want to be  honest and i like it here  uh...  there's no way to dig yourself out of what you know i'm just saying what  the head of well you know because i'm sitting there watching the htp of special  and i'm already feeling weird because i'm looking at naked guys but it never 
[08:30]
 right cross my mind like while this would be better if the guys were  exactly well i don't know where because i'm looking at slugs it never crossed my  mind to tape it like anthony did so i can watch it in a later date again  oh yeah yeah i got me with that one  oh-ho-ho-ho  i just happened to bring it in so we could take clips off of it  you would think the producer would tape it if we want clips for the show  you know what you want to keep your copy at home  hi what do you got  hi i'm calling in about their little comment about the lfm exposed 
[09:00]
 and i totally agree with them where they said that it would have been a lot  better if they had better than that  well but i'm a girl but it was for women wasn't it  yeah but rick is i don't know why rick wanted to see how the guys i had a guy  it was maybe maybe he got away like i know  i mean i can understand the lady saying that go well i wish the guys were hotter  or like chipping down as whatever but this is coming from a guy and i doesn't  think that way when he's looking at a naked guy i'm watching that whole bunch 
[09:30]
 of guys on their interplay you know big and smaller penises and what really made  me laugh is most of these guys out there were intimate they weren't even in the  ladies now when i'm watching that mess in the wheelchair or the the fat old guy  that has to pump it up with a little with a little airbag in his sack i'm not  going  playfully you know he's like that  but i was comparing his little cigar that he was not in the event that mall  he's going to be in the air we got his audio will play the little a very 
[10:00]
 pathetic right but thanks for calling  thank you all right by all i'm saying of the earth was done would have been easier  to watch because i had to watch it for sure i'll be right now is it easier to  watch it's the same difficulty degree of difficulty if it's a mess  or it's like what is considered a hot guy for a guy sitting watching  the same thing thank you it doesn't matter if it's a hot a hot guy i can't  believe you're saying to do with that i had no idea 
[10:30]
 i never said the word hot guy  never said  and then you're looking for two  faces  all right now and just back back at all yet punch out punch out you can discuss  this for two hours is just gonna get worse for you you're going in there's no  landing this craft of the wings are shot off it's in flames punch out i'm marks  back to the strike from trying to march back in the studio is get all the clips 
[11:00]
 from our guys so that will play a few of those we got lots of their just getting  started here now you're done on the fire  i'm turning my golf is to save you just take a good thing you turned it off with  his got it in his mouth now  the right of new york one oh two seven w a w two for tuesday with uh... zeppelin  on the way we got a couple from the clash it's open anthony day 
[11:30]
 man trying to come down a little bit here  well uh... hoping  uh... i didn't even uh...  address this but  and you should get some washer fluid  your windshield in this type of weather  you uh... you drove today yes i did  it's one of those days where the snow is melting very warm gets on the roads the  salty roads and the spray comes up on the windshield and you can see anything  and uh... if there's not enough liquid or if it remains on your windshield too 
[12:00]
 long it dries you hit your wife or what happens to smears  and you can see through it the app laid out on your windshield well i had some  uh... wiper fluid when we started the right in today yes and then i ran out  halfway through  and then you got to play that little game with the other cars in the highway  yeah  because now that my windshield is smeared  and i thought so i speed up to the car in front of me because they're splashes  and water up onto my windshield and my windshields clear again and i have to  back off so don't get too much sprinkles on my own windshield and there's that 
[12:30]
 little thing you got it you got to decide is there enough liquid on the  windshield to clear it off or is it going to smear it or it  right now that looks like an outfit that  quack  and i can i need more one who had been the bottle  and then you got a lot  i know there are there are times i've taken the snow  off the top of my car and thrown it on my windshield as you drive in  uh... any beverage you might have i've used up at c in the past  it's worse at night 
[13:00]
 because i mean at night if if your windshield is that you might as well  drive to the through kaleidoscope mhm so it looks like you just see a thousand  taillights  so you throw in the pepsi  and i a s  speed  just trying to get enough liquid on your windshield by the way i was the lazy guy  today to that uh... i didn't brush off the top of my car i noticed and where we  live we got almost a foot of snow yeah a lot of people in the city area do really  get as much jersey got a lot  but uh... long island a lot of the north shore yeah and uh... i was the lazy guy 
[13:30]
 just driving down the l i a with almost a foot of snow the top of my car i just  heard things cracking off of your car and flying i'm looking in the mirror to  see if things flying through the air  i was that guy today guys and get behind a tractor trailer that hits a bomb  and that sheet of ice will fly off the the back of it  you just hear it  and what do you think when you see that and then you go and at first it's  and i'll look at that that's getting some altitude yet 
[14:00]
 look at that  it's coming right for me  and i don't think that  this is your windshield and then you're happy or water yeah you know if you can  i think we don't play with you and and and and and and and and and and and and  uh... this crap is just about over though  you know we didn't really get that hit that that we didn't get any real ice  where you had to get out there and scrape with your uh...  cassette case if you don't have a an ice cream i was laughing at all the people  because when we were getting to the highway today 
[14:30]
 there were a bunch of people of shovel their driveways and stuff  what bother don't bother to be like sixty tomorrow this does can be done by  friday melted melted probably by tomorrow most of it don't you worry but  there are people out there shoveling their driveways and stuff yet  i think people enjoy doing that you think and  shoveled driveway i think the boss is finally leaving  is he good day has jacket on his walking down the hall so  no sniffling stays talking about i was feverish and he's got the flu and he's 
[15:00]
 sick  spent like a month now well i think a lot of people who related work to get the  boss or someone that's taking the coming to work it's like  don't come into work again when i was sick all the dissent  uh... of you  i don't my throat i'm sick  well that's what the boss did doesn't come in and i say uh... you guys got a  few minutes and before he said that he goes i got the flu and he's like wiping  his  flee on and on his nose and he's sniffling in coffin  my mom meeting with you unless you get the the boy in the plastic bubble suit 
[15:30]
 the box in the plastic ball and boss in the plastic bubble you get the judge  will pass it will meet with you  it justin that's the big bubble in his office and that is like and they like no  guys in series and he talked to you for a few minutes and and i'm like yeah i'm  serious too  hopes cover in his mouth for the shirt well do you blame me no  someone's like sneezes a hundred yards from me i get sick  don't need the boss like wiping snot all over his hand  and he should go home they want to shake our hand and stuff for some time 
[16:00]
 dot on your now  you know i was infested of course he is stay in the office shut the door  and just hold up notes  at the window  homos in parade  tomorrow they're screwing it up  high-end w and what's up on how are you know what's going on all right  we gotta send a message  what's the uh... what's the problem sir we gotta keep the fed to wait for a  tomorrow  this is your crops of every year doesn't have come on it's such a pain i march 
[16:30]
 every year  yeah every year it  same old crap well what uh... what group are you part of i'm part of the emerald  society okay here's the deal i don't really care if if you're gay all right  that's that's the guys i was just not being done all right listen listen listen  but i honestly strongly feel that they should not march in the saint patty's  state parade  it has nothing to do with that no as as a gay group as a gay group if you're a  gay guy and you play the bagpipes or something like that you know i don't  mean that in a pun type if you play the bagpipes you know getting you get in 
[17:00]
 there as a group  and you're a gay guy uh... part of  a group as a human  as an irishman maybe marching in the parade  you don't march you know  with uh... the transvestite uh...  stockings on city you can't do it the uh... g-string and that i'm trolling  they think  saint patrick parade well i mean but getting back to it i just don't think  uh... there should be a bunch of people that are marching just as they are gay  it but it's not just that 
[17:30]
 it's they want to get they have to mess they have to you know  get involved by  creating all the problems in  you know if they cut in as a as a regular organization and it eventually we let  the march  then that's one thing you know what we should know testing and all right well  we got your point but no we should do  that we've been it's too late now we should got a bunch of guys together that  love lesbians  we should have got a bunch of guys that love lesbians will get a nice banner  will march in the parade was the difference that's not a prize for less 
[18:00]
 it's a group of guys that love lesbians and we're going to march in the parade  who love levin's more than that  there you go so beautiful place so we should have got a hundred of us together  you know we could have been all drunk and stuff got a banner and when we're in  the parade to what difference you know what it's a sexual preference thing but  you know how stupid they are  what's the worst thing that can happen to a queer we have got a bunch of  drunken irishman  all of us got to get a good beat  all my god look at this guy just advocating violence i'm not advocating 
[18:30]
 it but it does happen  and hey if you know you are doomed as a society man we are friggin doomed as a  society not a beautiful thing  i don't agree with that it can't be beating people because of their ideas  because i don't like it i think people because they have to try to stop the  parade now that isn't why you want to go running in front of everybody on your  camera you're beating them because as you say are their fags well i don't  think you should beat anybody if you have a problem with them 
[19:00]
 take it up by uh... with through a discussion  and intelligent uh... debate  and that would have happened if i think you that they want to smoke the meat  pipe  they say no right  and i don't know if you're with this guy come on is out  you know i think that that the flamboyant gays ruin it  for uh... gays that are uh... an integral part of society  that one march in parades because  if you're a guy and you want to take your kid to the parade you want to see  a parade you want to see you know the bands walk by in the fire trucks and fun 
[19:30]
 stuff like that  you don't want to see a transvestite  with his thing hanging out  and g-strings and guys making out in  and stop in the street  that's what ruins the whole thing that's what people don't like  yeah based on what the lots of great and i don't know about it  hey daddy what are those two guys don't  that doesn't look like a bagpipe  we don't advocate beating jay stum come come course my i mean that's obvious 
[20:00]
 honestly we could be outrageous and say we do but that's just ridiculous you know  what it is that unfortunately there there are people out there that uh...  like that. What can you say?  Alright Anthony stacker two.  What?  Stacker two.  So you're fake and I'm really on the stuff again today.  I know.  Because I worked out, I'm feeling a little tired, a little lethargic so I popped another  stacker two. It's like drinking a pot of coffee. It really is.

The Rock of New York 1027W&EW, two for Tuesday with The Clash. This is Radio Clash and Lyndon  Collin. It's Opie and Anthony.  Everybody wants to talk about the HBO special from last night.  So I guess we could do a little more of that for you.  A lot of people watched that I guess. Pretty disturbing. 
[21:30]
 It really was. Did we learn anything last night?  No.  Did the ladies learn anything? Maybe the ladies did. I don't know. I think it's any guy watching  just yelling, yeah. I've owned one for quite a while and pretty much know how it works.  If you're just tuning in, HBO did a whole show with a bunch of guys, most of them naked,  talking about their schlongs.  Talking about what they use it for, how they use it, how they feel about it. Kind of weird. 
[22:00]
 We got some great audio clips. Let's take a quick couple of calls here.  Hey, Matt. What do you got, man?  Opie and Anthony?  Yeah, you're live on the air.  You guys, all three of you are a bunch of homos. I can't believe you're arguing with  Rick about him describing the guys as better looking guys.  I'm on the same page. I switched over from WWF, battling my scanty the whole night to  keep everyone getting to turn it off. Put on the HBO thing, and I'm like, you know what?  This is really not for me. The fact that these guys are naked, discussing their schlongs,  you own one, you know how it works, you know what it looks like. There's no hidden secret, 
[22:30]
 no owner manual that you didn't get. What were you hoping to learn from by watching  some fat guy talking about his nuts?  It's going to make for some great radio today. That's the only reason I watch. That's the  guys' honest truth. Anthony called me three times. We were laughing our asses off.  Let me tell you, I finished watching Raw's War, which ran until I think 11.05.  Yeah, right.  So, you know, I wasn't, don't let me go to the weenie show.  I'm like, you know, I put it on and I was like, wow, this is pretty disturbing. 
[23:00]
 But I watched because it was kind of like a freak show. It was kind of funny listening  to that 58-year-old guy talk about how small his penis was.  Right. You know, I'm all for the documentary, like, you know, hoes up and pimps down and  all that other stuff.  Yeah, those are my faves.  And there was the stripper one. I can get my family to watch the stripper ones too.  But with the guys, just couldn't do it, man. And I understand you two, you got to show  to do. What's Rick's excuse, man? What does he have to contribute? And the fact that he's 
[23:30]
 contributing, I mean, the fact that he's critiquing them.  Well, that's the problem. Rick earlier said that he wished the guys were kind of hotter.  I heard that part. And this thing took himself out of the hole and is making it worse.  Oh, absolutely.  I mean, Anthony and I admitted, yes, we are looking at naked guys talking about their  schlongs, but that's where it ended. Rick went a little further and decided that it would have  been a better special if the guys weren't what? Messes?  It could have been a naked gorilla sitting there or a chip-n-nail dancer. To me, it didn't matter.  You just sit there going, ew. You know, these naked guys. But for some reason, Rick has a 
[24:00]
 difference. He likes whether they're hot or not. I don't know.  And I don't think we're alone today. I think a lot of guys checked out that special. Some as a  goof, some as maybe checking out a freak show, maybe some to be educated. I don't know.  Some to be turned on.  Let's get a woman's point of view here. Hello?  Hello?  Hi, who's this?  This is Chris.  Hi, Chris. What do you got?  Well, they were talking about that special and I happened to watch it last night and I didn't 
[24:30]
 really understand what they were trying to prove.  I think it was just HBO trying to be a little shocking.  It was retarded. I mean, as soon as I saw the Asian guy and he was naked, I said, oh, that's going to be small.  And of course it was.  Yeah, a lot of stereotypes there.  And then they had that black guy who was...  The guy just sitting on the chair with his legs spread out.  I'm sorry?  The guy just sitting on the chair with his legs spread apart.  Well, not only that. 
[25:00]
 You guys are listening to the radio.  You guys turned on your radio.  Oh, I'm sorry.  But yeah, so I'm waiting for them to pan down and I'm on the phone with my boyfriend because he called me.  He's like, put on HBO.  See?  And I'm like, wow.  And I'm like, they're panning down.  This guy, he's supposed to be, what, a porn star or something?  Correct.  They're waiting for them to pan down.  They didn't.  Then there was that one guy who, what would he do?  He would pull on it or something and he'd say, this is how it gets really big.  And then that 52-year-old engineer guy, yeah, nice physique, but he was a jerk. 
[25:30]
 He'd be like, I'm standing there pulling on his flange.  Yeah, there was one guy that he had some doctor tell him how to make it longer.  Right. And he was pulling on it.  Yeah, he said...  Every hour, every hour of the day.  Yeah, he puts weights on it.  He said he hangs weights from it to pull it.  Yeah, what's up with that?  He stands up and it just kind of...  And I'm like, well, maybe there's something to that.  He had some girth though.  I don't know, was he pulling it sideways too?  He had some girth.  I don't know.  I don't know what that was about.  That guy's whole life was about his schween.  Oh, absolutely. 
[26:00]
 He was really into it.  Oh, yeah.  And the guy with the little one, the old guy with the little peanut one.  The poor guy, I kind of felt bad for him, but that made everybody else feel good, I'm sure.  His whole gig was that he was just this bitter guy and he's trying to justify how girls really  like the little ones and how it doesn't matter, size doesn't matter.  He was saying that at one point when he said, he liked to do it with the lights out because  he's ashamed.  Well, we got that clip.  We're going to play it in a little while.  Oh, yeah.  Well, have you been with a few guys in your career? 
[26:30]
 A few guys?  A few guys.  You know, have you been with a number of gentlemen during your...  I said, yeah.  So, the small guy?  Yeah.  And was it kind of funny?  Hold on.  Ah, go on.  She put me on hold.  She's at work.  Hold on.  She's gone.  Anyway, we wanted to know if she left.  Yeah.  I'm sure she did.  We got some audio from the show last night.  And we got that... what was he, a doctor, a slang expert?  He was some kind of professor of slang. 
[27:00]
 Yeah.  Slang encyclopedia or something.  And he was talking about names that people give their schlongs.  Well, slang terms for the eshween, yes.  Yes.  Let's take a listen to this.  People were using slang terms for the penis in Chaucer's time and in Shakespeare.  There are examples.  Common ones like cock, going back to the 17th century.  Dickies was very common in the 19th century.  One-eyed wonderworm or trouser trout or a personal favorite.  Purple helmet, love warrior, hot beef injection for the sex act. 
[27:30]
 The penis maximus.  And these aren't ones that people use seriously.  You don't go around talking about it that way.  But you make jokes about it.  It's funny to refer to it that way because that's one way to defuse its impact.  The guy was telling everyone this with a serious face.  He's being all serious.  Yeah.  It's like, shut up.  You hear what you're saying?  You start making those names up when you're in the second grade.  He's made a career of it.  Log on to WNEW.com.  It's all from Killian's Irish Red, the official beer of St. Patrick's Day. 
[28:00]
 1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, two for Tuesday with the Stones, Monkey Man and Hang Fire.  You're hanging with Opie and Anthony.  Maggie on the Instant Feedback from Jersey writes,  Please tell us again where you guys are going to be tomorrow afternoon.  I'm going to the parade and want to stop by and see you guys in action.  Well, we're broadcasting live tomorrow.  We haven't been out since...  We haven't been out since the famous Valentine's Day celebration.  Yeah.  Remember that one baby.  We're going to try to outdo ourselves tomorrow at Le Barbat. 
[28:30]
 Yes, that's what, 57th between 8th and 9th, right?  Broadcasting from 3 to 7.  We want to see everyone out there.  Live.  Come down, make some noise, have fun.  St. Patty's Day.  A lot of people around the building are scared.  They want to know what we're going to be doing at this broadcast tomorrow, Anthony.  Yeah, everybody's coming up saying, we need a plan.  Like they want something planned out and written down.  We ran through a pretty much a game plan for Valentine's Day.  Who's going to be on, who's coming, what they're going to be doing. 
[29:00]
 Everyone needs this organization thing.  I'm sure a lot of our freaks will show up and stuff, but we don't have much of a plan  because I think tomorrow most people are going to be just hammered.  Yeah.  Fear is going to be the star of the show tomorrow.  St. Patty's Day.  We'll have some cool stuff to give away and we'll play some little wacky game or something.  But you know, come on.  We don't need a plan for everything.  We got a couple tricks up our sleeve.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  That's all we need to know, right?  Don't you worry about it.  All right.  They get nervous around here unless you write everything down, letter of intent or something. 
[29:30]
 You say that with the boss right next to you.  Well, I'm not talking about you.  The big boss man.  I always use that one.  Well, not you.  You know, the people that work like you, but not you.  I've never required you to write anything down, have I?  No, see?  That's what I mean.  Not you.  You know, I think Scott gets a bad rap.  We've never had a problem with you.  No, Scott's cool. 
[30:00]
 And that's not us just kissing your ass.  We've had a good relationship thus far.  We're not pretty consistent.  That'll change though.  No, Scott's pretty good.  Until last night when I was battling with my seven-year-old about his allowance.  Yeah, that was really...  How'd that work out?  It worked out fine for me.  He's still getting a buck, huh?  He's still getting a buck.  You're tough.  We had Scott's son in here yesterday, seven years old, Greg.  Seven years old.  And we found out that he only gets a dollar allowance, dollar a week.  But he said, we asked him what he does and he said nothing.  Now for a kid to even say that, because even if you did nothing, you would try to make something  up.  Well, I put my shoes in the closet.  I keep my room neat.  Yeah, I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat. 
[30:30]
 I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat. 
[31:00]
 I keep my room neat.  I keep my room neat.  So that's what he's getting up early for to play games.  And they've got to share a computer at your house?  Yeah, and I really should get a computer for everybody, but you know it just seems a little  bit, uh, nobody would talk at all.  Right.  Nobody would talk at all.  Oh, you need some kind of communication.  Yeah, but it's better the kids are on the computer than in front of the TV like we had  when we were growing up.  You know?  The allowance thing is tough.  I mean, you never quite know.  Like my oldest, we had to keep giving him more money, so we had more money to take away  from him when he did things wrong. 
[31:30]
 Like he got five bucks and then every week he'd like, oh, it was two dollars.  I gave him eight.  So he'd feel like he was losing money.  It just kept getting bigger, but he never saw the money.  He figured it out.  He figured it out.  Yeah.  The more he misbehaves, the more money he gets.  What is the right amount?  Wow, man, more than a buck.  Come on.  He's solid.  Where's he going?  It's not like going out to the movies.  But a kid needs money in his pocket.  This is how he gets off to his friends, you know?  My daughter likes to save money.  She's 11 now.  Yeah. 
[32:00]
 She had like $80 saved up.  Like she goes out and loses it all.  Loses it?  What, at the track?  She can't find the wallet.  Like somewhere...  Oh, she lost it, lost it.  Ooh, that's bad.  That's bad.  She must be really upset.  Why didn't you replace it?  Say, you did?  That's a good parent.  What a guy.  My parents would have done the same thing.  What, replace it?  Yeah.  I'd have gotten a gig.  You irresponsible ass.  I remember being 12 years old and I was a caddy and I made like 40 bucks in one day and I  was just loving life.  And I lost the money on the way home.  And my parents went around the golf course with me trying to find the money and then 
[32:30]
 when we couldn't find it, they replaced it, man.  Wow.  That's cool.  Spoiled brat.  That's not spoiled.  You're lying.  Spoiled brat.  Worked my ass off.  Let's know.  It's tough watching people play bad golf.  It is.  As a 12 year old getting yelled at and stuff.  It wasn't fun.  There you have it.  Should I raise your guy's allowance?  Yeah.  Well now we understand why your kid only gets it the top of the week. 
[33:00]
 At least you're not consistent.  Yeah, there was no surprise there.  At least he doesn't have somebody taking 10% of it.  Yeah, we have an agent for him to negotiate his allowance.  Is that what he is?  The one we see him.  Does anyone else want to be our agent?  It's time to make a sweat.  Yeah.  Anything else going on upstairs, boss?  No, phones are very quiet.  The email has been really great. 
[33:30]
 What's the top story today on 1010 wins?  Getting ready for St. Patrick's Day.  Oh yes.  Big in New York.  Warmer weather coming in.  Slow news day.  Slow news day.  John Calipari.  Yes.  Fire.  Is that a good movie thing?  You know what?  Too soon.  It is too soon.  This is a waste of a season.  You can't do it.  You can't fire any coaches.  Everybody has been injured.  Look at that team.  I mean they have an unbelievable team on paper.  Right.  But a lot of the guys are hurt.  You know?  There must be something else there. 
[34:00]
 Do you think they are going to fire Van Gundy like they are saying that?  I hope not.  I think Van Gundy is great.  I think they fire him so they bring Jackson in next year.  I think so.  Oh, without a doubt.  Jackson is coaching somewhere next year.  It's either going to be LA or the Knicks.  Or maybe the Nets.  He played for the Nets I think for a year or two.  Phil Jackson played for the Knicks.  But didn't he at the end of his career play a year or two?  We should check that.  I don't remember that.  I just remember him playing with Bradley and DeBush and Frazier.  He was a Knick for life but I think at the very end of his career I think maybe he played 
[34:30]
 a year for the Nets.  I'm surprised the phones aren't ringing.  Someone should know the answer to that.  Yeah, Rick.  We're just bolting out of the studio to check his research library.  Alright.  Yeah, but the email has been great.  I think people are liking you.  Oh, don't get carried away.  Well, we'd like that as well.  Except the guy who ran yesterday and said, oh, the boss is really good with that allowance.  His wife must be on food stamps and cheese rations.  And government cheese.  That was funny though. 
[35:00]
 In fact, you know what?  I think the fax number was from Anthony's office.  Uh-oh.  He's on to me.  I've got to delete that.  We've asked all our faithful listeners to send in feedback about the show and we've  all read every single one of them.  There's no way we're going to be able to write everyone back but we're getting a good idea  of what you guys are into.  We're a good team on paper.  Just like the Nets.  Yeah.  Alright.  We've got more to come.  Did you see the HBO Dick special yesterday?  No.  It was called Private Dick's.  Yeah, that was the name of the show. 
[35:30]
 Was it good?  And it was about guys sitting there naked talking about their things.  It was amazing.  Just amazing that they even have that.  HBO.  That's entertainment.  Well, you could just be dialing around the channel and hit HBO.  It's not like you've got to flip a switch and turn dials and tune in shortwave.  So like any kid could go around and boom, full frontal nudity.  You know?  There was a nation.  But it's under the guise of this kind of educational program.  Yeah, educational sociology kind of thing, you know? 
[36:00]
 So they get away with it.  It's cable.  Right.  We've got more audio from the show.  We'll play that next.  Full frontal male nudity on television.  Who wants to see that?  The Rock of New York 1027 WNEW.  Two for Tuesday.  REM, Lotus from Up.  And what's the frequency?  Kenneth.  It's Opie and Anthony.  On the way we've got some tunes from ACDC.  Stay right there.  And a lot of people asking for Lord Comover today, Anthony.  Lord Comover. 
[36:30]
 Brand new character made his debut on the show yesterday.  The evil mayor of the Empire.  Yeah.  We've got to replay that from yesterday.  Yeah.  I think we missed Lord Comover.  It'll be a little after five, I guess.  It's pretty damn funny, I think.  Boy.  We've got to thank one of our faithful listeners.  I think Dave in the city came up with the name Lord Comover and then Anthony took it to the  next level.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think it fits the mayor, Rudy.  Yeah, definitely.  You see the little pictures of ex-mayor there, Dinkins getting busted. 
[37:00]
 Yeah, what do you think of that?  Civil disobedience.  Yeah.  I don't know.  It's kind of a little publicity thing.  It's kind of cute.  Yeah.  I think when people want to make a statement and they get arrested, they should really  throw them in the joint with the boys.  Yeah, it's just kind of a technicality.  Yeah, not the cute like, oh, you got arrested, oh, you got handcuffed for ten minutes and  then they released you.  They give them the zip strip handcuffs, not even the tin ones. 
[37:30]
 If you're going to go the distance, they should just throw you in with the boys in the yard  for a day.  Yeah.  You know?  Sure.  Anyone could get arrested.  It's not that scary.  Did you see Dinkins being someone's biatch?  In the joint?  In the joint?  Put him in Rikers.  Man, selling him for some smokes or something.  Yeah, that'd be much more exciting instead of like all the news organizations, oh, Dinkins  got arrested.  Wow, look, he's in handcuffs.  Yeah, five minutes and then he's back on the street. 
[38:00]
 It was no big deal.  No, I ask him questions.  It's like nothing.  some good stories.  I was in there.  I nearly got shanked in the yard.  In the yard?  I nearly got shanked.  I was someone's biatch.  Yes, I was.  I was a biatch.  Well, we've got to play more of the audio from the HBO show from last night.  Private Dicks.  Yeah, Private Dicks.  This is just a huge thing for the ladies, I think, because there's not usually full 
[38:30]
 frontal male nudity on television.  It's HBO, but I mean it's accessible to everybody pretty much.  Well, we need the ladies to call in if they saw the show last night.  We want to get your point of view because to a guy, I think it was a complete waste  of time.  Yeah, I mean, they're not teaching us anything new.  No, I want to see if the ladies learned anything.  I know Jennifer was cracking up through most of it.  It's pretty funny. 
[39:00]
 And then she's asking me, like I know, these little insights.  Today, she was rewinding the tape so I could bring it in and we could get some sound off  of it.  So she goes by this one part where this guy stands up, kind of grabs his thing, swings  it around once, and then like flops it between his thighs.  And she goes, wait a minute, wait.  She rewinds and goes, watch this, watch.  I go, what?  I'm on the computer.  I'm not paying attention.  She goes, watch this, go on.  So he does it again. 
[39:30]
 She goes, now what is that?  I don't know.  She thought I'd have an answer.  Like, oh, that's the spinning flop.  Every guy does it.  You learn it at six years old, the spinning flop.  The only move I know is I could make it look like a turtle.  You ever do the chick thing?  Yeah.  You stick it down and you put your legs together and high.  You do that in front of your wife?  No.  Are you kidding?  Whatever. 
[40:00]
 All right.  We've got some great audio to play here.  We've got to do the condom thing.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  All right.  Do you want the audio of the Slang Expert or that real weird 50s educational voice?  Educational voice.  All right.  You want to start with that?  All right.  Explain this real fast because a lot of people out there didn't see this last night.  Yeah.  People are explaining condom use and they must have dug up this clip from this old 50s 
[40:30]
 hygiene and one of those films.  You ever see those old 50s films?  They're not really realistic.  People in them like beaver cleaver and stuff and they're talking about the penis.  Well, this one was for rubbers and how not to catch communicable diseases.  I'm assuming they played this in the 50s in health class.  Yeah, this looked like one of those health films.  All right.  Check this out.  Keep something between you and the germs of an aerial disease by using a good rubber 
[41:00]
 inflated with air as you would a toy balloon until the rubber is fully extended.  It may be further tested by filling it with water and noting if any oozing is present.  When you are through, unroll the rubber.  If the woman has gonorrhea or syphilis, as she probably has, there will be millions of  the germs on the rubber and on the surfaces surrounding the penis.  As she probably has.  What is that all about? 
[41:30]
 I fell on the floor laughing when I heard that line as she probably has.  What the hell is that?  That's not very nice.  No, not at all.  I guess they figure any girl having sex has a disease.  Yeah.  Anyone else is your wife.  And that's bizarre.  I think we got a lady in the line here.  Hi, NW.  Hi.  Hi.  You saw the show last night.  Oh my God.  I was so appalled watching that.  Were you?  I watched it last night with my boyfriend and I thought it was going to be like taxicab 
[42:00]
 confession.  Yeah.  It was so disgusting.  We had to turn it off.  I could not believe it.  There were so many old people on that show.  It was really gross.  Yeah.  Well, they're not going to get many, many other people.  It was pretty much gay guys and old people.  I know.  They had that one guy that was the porn star.  He was on there.  What does he care?  I know.  But I just thought it was really, really foul.  I couldn't believe that they actually were showing that on HBO.  Well, you know what it is.  See, this just goes to show ladies too.  You know when we put pictures up on the website of girls, naked girls, and we always get a 
[42:30]
 ton of phone calls from girls going, why don't you do something for the ladies?  Why don't you do something for the ladies?  Let me explain something.  But that wasn't for ladies.  No, no.  Let me explain something.  Guys can look at naked women.  Don't have to know them.  They don't even have to look all that hot.  It doesn't matter.  We can look.  We can enjoy.  Women have to be in a relationship with a guy or the guy has to be an Adonis for them  to glance at the penis and think it's attractive.  Because most of the girls think it's anus. 
[43:00]
 With good right.  Because it is.  It really was.  It was really, really bad.  I cannot believe.  Dopey turtle head.  I can't see the guy with the cigar.  It's Mr. Penis.  I thought the guy with the cigar was the best though.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  The guy with the cigar was the best though.  Oh that said his was two inches.  Yes.  Something like that.  That guy was so sad.  We made fun of him or something like that.  On the other end of the spectrum, there was the guy with the huge one that was talking  about how he's got to be careful he doesn't hurt the girls he's with. 
[43:30]
 It's 15 inches.  Oh.  All right.  I got the audio of the guy with the two inches.  This is pretty bad.  This is pretty damn sad.  All right.  Thanks for calling in.  Thank you.  All right.  Yeah.  This guy.  He was the star of the show.  just a mass the uh... was making the yet sure son alright  and he was talking about how small his thing was and he had like a little  almost like a white out cigar so little bigger cigar allows yes is a relevant  and he said that the the size of his thing is uh... have to size of the 
[44:00]
 cigar he was uh... smoking yeah  so here's the audio of the uh... the guy with the two-incher  my hand  penis is about  the size of this  cigar  when it's a wrecked and  uh... it's rather tiny  it  what an ending the rock of new york one of the seven w a w a c d c and the jack  from high voltage  open at the end with their having a fun you guys are about this act 
[44:30]
 flight a great instant feedback coming in  yeah i got one  let's say arjane pat and suspects  they want to know what happened to the three breasted check that was supposed  to show up in the studio for photo shoot i i i think we got had on that one yeah  we definitely got had uh... i don't know though because there is a possibility  that we scared her off as we will start abusing her in the listeners really  started by losing it we have this girl on that swore  she had three breasts  jen to d 
[45:00]
 and i'd be in the middle  now i want to go on record as saying  when she called i said i thought it was fake  you know i was very skeptical because  um... breasts don't grow like that  one on each side one of the middle  people with three breast or four breast  it's the line down the side below  the existing breast like uh... if you have a see a dog right now they have  their little nips  they're in a lot  straight down but we did have a medical expert to say that uh... that they have  had some dopey girl all of them say that i still say there is no way 
[45:30]
 a breast  could grow  another breast if a girl shows up here  with a boob in the middle of two boobs i will give her a hundred bucks  a hundred on the spot you give her like a foul  nodded i'd  we give two hundred by two hundred  two hundred but it's got to be a real breast in the middle and cannot is it  not a mall  not in it  i'm talking abreast what if she has uh... uh... it's just a net 
[46:00]
 but it's a it's obvious it's a net in the middle  obvious and that not there's got to be something that you can't you can't say a  birthmarks in it look at the net  signal at the birth by getting it now it's got to be a net what if it's an  obvious nipple  all right if we get enough people we we got a panel of judges that can look at  it  and say yes that is indeed  in that in the middle of two uh... normal breast right  in the middle  and not all set to to underneath the bull well we've had a lot of email on that 
[46:30]
 and uh... i'd i guess we've been had but  i'm not sure if i'll come down but then the listeners started going not to be  using her and i have  a party thought that maybe she just got scared off you can have a press on the  same horizontal plane  well i think other boobs i'd like to think that this possible i saw them  uh... total recall  you know the little fidget girl at the three votes and i thought that great  well a lot of jokes uh... about that was you know yeah  now where was this other one about uh... jim 
[47:00]
 yeah jim from jersey okay i just heard you mention uh... did you ever do that  girl thing  about ten minutes ago  uh... you know we take your uh...  your unit your package all of the uh...  jewels  and kind of put it between your thighs  and cross your legs so there's nothing there  and uh...  he says no offense but i thought it was known as the silence of the lamb things  that's good remember that it puts the notion in the basket or gets the hose 
[47:30]
 again and those again it puts the notion in the basket  or gets the hose again is that disturbing  uh...  uh...  and  uh... pretty nasty well a lot of people have been requesting a lord come over  today  lord come over this really just came out of nowhere but uh...  that that's self-explanatory  one oh two seven w any w the rock of new york days in the new june for tuesday 
[48:00]
 they shall be in the room and touch peel and stand taking a little music uh...  breaks their soviet and a for smack these people with the uh... personal  assistant things  those little handheld things  when the palm pilot  you know the technology isn't quite there like the tricorder in star trek yet  okay  they're not voice activated yet that that  they pull out and you ever try to get someone your number now that has one of  these  they pull out their little  palm pilot they're all proud of

 the kind of someone's dad grandfather and  you just on tv i don't know i i i didn't see anyone normal on that show i think  they went to the port authority or something  right here's a lady that's got some comments about the show that  high-end w  that guy went by with the foot thing  yeah that would be that would be going to have to pay no expansion  and that would be excited about it to you know help it along  really like the guy with the box at the old i would put the ball guy only had a  penis extension  yes you did and then we have to have guy 
[54:30]
 who had the full skin put back on that was so gross  and you couldn't even see anything  he had an any penis  that was the funniest thing i have seen in my life i was on the floor laughing  that was so funny there was so much going on in that show what about the old guy talking  about how he has to pump it up to have sex  he's almost crying  yeah it was so funny  the guy i hate the most is the chinese guy he totally grossed me out  the old guy gets all over his chest a little too much about the penis 
[55:00]
 oh i thought it was very amusing  i was laughing my ass off i kept calling anthony he kept calling me  i was calling my girlfriend we were calling each other back and forth we were dying  it was so funny  i thought it was private dick i thought it was like the no soprano i'm thinking of like  new york cops or something and the next thing i say whoa  that was so funny  and the black guy bragging how you know  yeah but you never saw his they never went down what is that because he's the next rated  movie star i gotta go out and rent a flick now that's what that was all about 
[55:30]
 isn't that weird though the porno star was one of the only guys that didn't show his  penis  and he was kind of bragging saying how he has hurt women  he's a hard woman yeah come hurt me yeah that's right yeah  yeah but you didn't see nothing yeah so how much hurt could he have  uh... but you gotta admit the the fave of the show was the fifty eight year old guy  with the two-incher  the  it  and i think that i would be a lot of that that they are they kept going to that guy  thought he was going to be the grand finale as the credits rolling 
[56:00]
 and i will tell you that it's really funny are called for a guy well we're  going to play the uh... that that's lying expert talking about me for condoms  that was funny that guy was cracking up let's check this out right here okay  the word condom itself goes back to the eighteenth century in scottish use  back then it referred to something made of sheep's intestine which is kind of  hard fathom nowadays but it shows that the term has been around for quite some  time in the twentieth century i think rubber has been the most common in use 
[56:30]
 throughout the century  uh... but scumbag has been around since the nineteen thirties and most people  really don't realize this everyone knows scumbag is a term for an offensive  person but in fact the original sense was a condom and that's based on the  slightly earlier use of scum for semen  some other ones more recently are glove referring to  condom which has its own spawn such as love club or stud club or even for  global  perhaps the most recent is jimmy had to wrap music terms coming from jimmy is a  term for the penis  and uh... one of the most recent and most offensive is going to be coney 
[57:00]
 island whitefish which refers to  the use condom and washes up on the seashore  that is my favorite  the old coney island whitefish yeah  all the only in new york you get good slang terms like the coney island  whitefish  uh... they look  they look at me is a car and i don't like it  the rock of new york  one of these seven w a w two for tuesday perfect strangers and 
[57:30]
 woman from tokyo deep purple  soviet anthony  and a bunch of people on the line that is one of our city as with us  one of the little fun let  i a m e w alfie a unit  they are you know  ticket are you pretty good  can get my email  uh... we've got many emails from you know so good  to get the one yesterday 
[58:00]
 which was yesterday  uh...  well with the from yesterday i can tell you if you if you got it  you would know  no i don't think i got it then  everyone's listening to this so i know how can you be on the record of the  public on the radio  off the record record we're not off the record we're on the right never  understand a word this girl's i hold on  he's this 
[58:30]
 high end of the u  high high what's up  nothing i don't want to uh... talk about that private deck cell at nine  but from what you guys are saying it was like a panel  of people there  panel you know i think you uh... ladies are getting us back today cuz everything  i have spent many many hours on our show talking about uh... women in there  and their tn a's and stuff right  and now today we have to talk about guys for a long time  yes you have to talk about today  well now you saw it 
[59:00]
 now i didn't know  why one day at that  i was in my car while i was on a personal your thing about  how you didn't think that women really wanted to look at the news  strong yes and i agree i don't think it's about that we want to be  you know the night to just be given that chance you know you get back saying in a  movie and it's usually  some check takes off all our clothes and i got a lot of fancy i don't see anything  well believe me there's a reason for that and that is that guys love looking 
[59:30]
 at naked girls it doesn't matter what kind of what they look like her  and they are not maybe i don't want to look at them guys  johnson yes i might want to look at it  well there are things about that guy that that are  really nice well they show that on  on t even now and my pd  yeah i don't mean i mean i'm talking full frontal uh... male nudity is like  something that uh...  i don't think there's a big demand for a lot of the time to hear all the girls  are always naked in the movies they show it all the time but i think they barely 
[60:00]
 show it well there's a reason no one wants to see that  but you want to have like a you want to leave have been able to come away and  say  like a guy come away from a very bad  well you know her kids are too bad or they were perfect and i'd like to walk  away and say you know what  i don't like that or i did like that  you know that  at least give me the opportunity to say you don't have to so you know men on  that and stay there for five minutes so you want to see more slongs on the tv and  in the movies have nudity and you know you would like to see the zoom in on the 
[60:30]
 girls though and stay there a while you would yes i think that there there's a  huge difference i don't care what people say as far as uh... what guys want to  see and what girls want to see as far as nudity goes guys are just a little bit  of a version  well-prepared  and  and i mean it just like oh yeah well naked yeah what guys are a lot of now  uh... we're we're not and i was like like like when we see i i naked woman 
[61:00]
 uh... we're like well that's hard and that looks good  girls you naked guy on t v and the movies like the  and the funny we need to have it doesn't happen  you know i mean it doesn't happen after all it like a little shocked when it  actually happened as a reason for that no one wants to say it and that's pretty  much it and i don't think people really want to say it  i think i think uh... the world was structured  in a way that  reproduction can go on  but work gets done to if if everybody was like 
[61:30]
 men  that never been nothing would ever get done because we'd all be having sex all  the time on the floor hours a day and then if everyone like women we've been  doing we'd have been a state state  i don't know  i'm not talking about everybody i am i am averaging out the human race  i mean i will agree that a woman body  in general is more beautiful  i think 
[62:00]
 yet and a bad ones a good one  uh... i don't know about that  how do you get that i don't know if they're pretty bad i'll tell you that  the guys like to look it doesn't matter if it's uh... a slob bending over a  period well if they got a real  that's a good day kind of style you know not a big pig is bending over and you  could look down the shirt and catch some of the image and the guy will do it  and i don't turn away the options back  you'd like  i guess i never heard of it  uh... that's that's how i i tell you are it's kind of it 
[62:30]
 and it's not that much a sexual thing is it's just kind of cold fun you know it's  sexual to me at the same time  when you're not expecting uh... to see see something and you do that's the best  yeah you talk about that before that is the best that you're driving down the  road and i i girls putting something in a truck and she's bent over too far so  uh... you know my god and you're just on the way to supermarket and i'm better  nothing better than the world is a pretty good not expecting it it just  comes out of nowhere i never have to actually get naked and i'm not good 
[63:00]
 you know given  and i think every now and then well  now and i have to get naked naked and more women need to get naked  uh... but when you want any work done that's true okay by us though  alright i love you guys and thank you but i can't  alright  uh... but we have more close to the show and then i thought what do we have now  well we got the old uh...  uh... fifty's voice  filmstrip type guy talking about early magazines 
[63:30]
 correct correct  another important problem  to the public on  participation in  labor that you do  of the god given  of  i'm example of one of the so-called early magazine  obviously calculated  emulate the reader  they'll  and there's a bar  judeo  inherently 
[64:00]
 along  will  pervert  absolutely i i agree with that  i didn't real faster we got uh... this is all for the ladies today  i guess we're uh... evening out the scorecard today one day  where's rick we got a views and we haven't uh... used in a couple hours  about his little faux pas earlier to know that was so funny  where the office earlier talking about this htp a special  on the male uh... penis  as opposed to the female one 
[64:30]
 uh... and and rick says  what did you say rick you said  it was hard to watch because of the god i don't listen and i don't know if that  is that it was a lot of money  it was hard to watch  because the guys are so skanky  it would have been easier to watch if there was some attractive guys with  with a nice-looking genitalia  all right i never said the word nice looking genitalia now you use the word  uh... for genitalia i can use here on the air  uh...  and now i'm going to the mail chicken what i said 
[65:00]
 uh...  let me preface this by saying that i am not gay never have been gay never  experimented or anything now protested to my  what i was saying what i meant listen everyone how he tried i will explain  that i was that  the process of sitting through that html special is arduous enough with these  with these ugly guys right they could have made it just a little bit easier to  deal with right  if the guys looked somewhat more normal instead of these freak shows they had 
[65:30]
 on  like that  it but it doesn't matter that never crossed my mind i felt skimmed out  because i'm looking at guys naked and that was all i needed to know if a girl  considers a guy attractive and he's sitting in the chair naked and a girl  considers a guy unattractive and he's sitting in the chair naked  i don't care which one i'm looking at i don't want to look at either yes it's  the same amount of discomfort  looking at it  and and and then then 
[66:00]
 it could be a naked monkey doesn't matter  but i'm just saying you would like the hot guy  the model  what the if you all of a sudden you'd be sitting there and say i say i was a guy  that sitting there that a girl thought was attractive  you would have sat there last night and on  okay this is easier to deal with his he's attracted his attractive  well i don't know if you're just face and would be bothered with it is fine  and i don't know if you're into it the guys face looks like that's even sicker  but at least it was some perverted with the the the penis okay is is one thing 
[66:30]
 but now you're  the faces all but you want to build a relationship that you know  but like i said earlier so anyway like i said earlier there's a gorilla  naked in a chair on that htl special right  that's all i need to know that i'm looking at a gorilla schlong right  that's bad enough for me but to start thinking it would be a cooler special  that the guy was hotter same level at art  hit the same level okay explain it out again as i mean goes in in flames you've  got  a woman that looks like seizing a yes sitting there naked 
[67:00]
 uh...  and let's see where you go i've got a woman that looks like saying  donald florida from good time okay i think they're naked right  now if you had to sit through and watch this okay  what would you prefer to see  for a while  first of all right now i would love to sit through looking at women naked so  when the insurer right  the uh... i would enjoy both bodies the eyes because it's a male rick there's a 
[67:30]
 difference yeah yet they don't have penises  i was never proven in florida's kids they have been  you know i don't think says is in the back office but two minutes before we  went on the air and then i looked at each other's home and i'm going to be  big how do you how do you make a statement like that you just can't that  it would be easier to watch if the guy was was cute all right  what about when you say in school  they should get rid of the handicap people because you know  people look at them and you can't study never said so whatever but he's not 
[68:00]
 looking at a handicapped swan but they had a handicap swan i don't want to see  a handicap guy in a chair with with  you are not making sense now you are now babbling out of your buttocks the more  you try to explain it the deeper you get it has nothing to do we're talking  about  the nude male form of the chair and nothing to do with retarded people or  florida evans from good times i have the nude male form in a chair idle once i  want 
[68:30]
 i'd gaze upon that on television  no changes  in that form  could have made it any more pleasurable for me or easier to digest exactly i  would say look and go  and kind of get a little you know  skied out now if you're a female i can understand your point of view exactly  shows a bunch of females out there that i thought what you're thinking about  exactly but it didn't come out of our lives  it from you know exactly the other reason why is it 
[69:00]
 i'm in touch with my family inside here a little too in touch with a little bit  hot guys on htl no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no  but  directly and he just like you blew it  i don't know what it was not a long way  but i don't think that's about time he gets in the air so i don't know i could  i just don't believe he came out with that play as there's nothing you could  say to make it better  i just trying to my job be quiet  and 
[69:30]
 i say something off the cuff in the office and both  it's a homo you know you know what it's like i'll tell you the the exact thing  you get shot in the head with a three fifty seven magnum right right in the  right between the eyes  and somebody goes  you know it would be better to get shot between the eyes with a thirty eight  uh...  doesn't matter at that point you're not mad  or thirty eight won't probably do as much damage you know you will  that would likely be ugly guy with a penis is doing more damage to me than 
[70:00]
 now you're still dead and with that analogy that anthony's on i want you  want to be shot in the head with a water pistol  by any double you  i'd like to give rick some advice okay who's uh... at this is that the gold  bridge i don't have a lady's point of view rick some you can relate to it  correct yeah  given up  quit while you're at it  well i think the president of the wheelchair at the marathon ahead 
[70:30]
 and don't say anymore  and i don't think anymore and it's just going to bury and that's just a fact  there's nothing to say right  when you're in quicksand ricky relax you know to the top of it  can't wait is a guy that wants to agree with rick and five here thank you  thank sake  some tells me can't march in the parade  i a m  but you know it was a money  but i'm a i would you get  i want to agree with rick there why 
[71:00]
 because  they are  you know that they've had it  that's not a good thing it's not all their name right  john holmes died of AIDS yes  alright back i i put him on a couple times on the tv dot what the porno  it's i have i got a shuttle  it's disgusting  but i do not get you to play wait wait you know what you know for the guy maybe  you'd like to agree with rick over dinner  no no no no  i don't want to put a girl like i got the two point on channel back-to-back on 
[71:30]
 cable tv right  the right now i'll put the other one even though i was given it to the girl  that i could make it a look at  uh... that's not see what are you talking about  you have to porno for the checks  yeah i don't want to tell you all of the big fat harry guys but he was a harder  guy you'd keep that point on  or it was a general right to look you up i think you're gay  it's a good day but  uh...  that's pretty funny 
[72:00]
 there's a lot of you know i don't know that it was it's in his apartment  falling back and forth before the general  uh... a caramba get out don't fight it rick  don't fight it  i a w  hi what's up  uh... i think there's nothing wrong with what rick said  why because i think that he's confident enough in the sexuality i don't think  you know  and i think that you know  if you look at it 
[72:30]
 uh... your female uh... that's you know the man maybe you guys are the crime  that's fine but we're talking about  the looking at the naked man yet and anyway shape or form making it more  pleasurable  to look at by changing his appearance it doesn't work  when you're a guy looking at a naked guy there's nothing that can make it  anymore uncomfortable  all look at it right again  out there he's got a lot of their home over it out right now we don't think 
[73:00]
 rick's a home all you can know but he just put his foot in his mouth and he's  uh... just a part of the uh... at least this is the put a foot in his mouth  at the end of the day and that if you can get out television and he's good  looking you cannot admit openly out loud and say that you've been looking but i  can look at a guy and say  i would think  that a girl would find him more attractive than him it's i can make that  distinction okay we're talking about looking at a naked man yet and it 
[73:30]
 being any better or worse depending on how he looks like  it doesn't work that way with a male mind and it is really not part of my  thought probably i can't i'll drive its gorgeous while i had a good looking guy  but who cares it's not even part of my thought process exactly  okay what you said brent it  well i don't know if you know i don't like but i don't want to go i'd like to  see brett at night now i don't want to do it and i would rather see brent  naked then you would have one of those fat guys if i was forced to watch it 
[74:00]
 like i had a lot of money and i don't know if i don't know if somebody else  they're not sure it's not a good doesn't matter  where rick buried himself he said he would enjoy he would have been joined  especially  and she or whatever you would have uh... like to show better and more  pleasurable yet  if the guys were  like quote hana or better looking  that's just weird  but i'm just saying you're just saying nothing 
[74:30]
 just like and i girls ready to say i i heard it talking ready to say well i  look at girls and i could decide which ones i'd rather see naked  that's girls girls are different does breed so girls said they're not girls  look at other girls and determine you know it obviously a girl would like to  see a a girl with a nice body as opposed to the slob exactly but they're girls  that's that only what you do you kiss your friends when you walk up there is  a good as a bathroom at the same time if there is a naked guy you know who who  just had his legs and arms chopped off would you rather see him or the guy with 
[75:00]
 with all the images  and do you know it doesn't really matter if you were forced to which one would  you rather say the guy who's laying there is a stump i would rather see the  stump as it's more of a freak show  not even depending on that not even based on anything that sexual i would  just see it because it's like wow guy norms no legs naked with a slug that's  that's a freak show that's fine  you find that good-looking i don't know  it's not a c l a m a and you know if you just not closet mull 
[75:30]
 uh... there's a strike and so hard and i was just grabbing it's not a giant  way out  they only have a little bit  uh... rick is cigarette and blindfold  and you know i couldn't finish the job with the bank even less time on why  game the wrong book you need a playground  direct  uh... yet as hot guys in their area  very good job right now  and everybody's growling at me now they're done and you are cooked it is 
[76:00]
 done that you should just send them out and all right i'll be quiet  you know i i i would have  we got a little bit of a little piece of the stuff you've done by  under the lab that it is so funny and twenty minutes to try to explain it to  himself and i was even deeper now it's worse now uh... five hundred thousand  people know about it said to have a lot of uh... all right uh... we got some  more audio from the show last night right  uh... the guy i had died audio of the record like that 
[76:30]
 now it's it's the slang guy  uh... yeah yeah the slang i was the best he sitting there and talking about slang  uh... terms for the guys who are on the end and for condoms  the right to be a hard one and seven w and w  with  so being at the end of the day by people bitching complaining as we haven't talked  about the two tonight on the club much today and then a well in the much too  busy have to talk about it every tuesday it just uh... happens
