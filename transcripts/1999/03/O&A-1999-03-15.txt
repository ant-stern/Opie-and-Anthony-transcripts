 The Rock of New York 1027 WNEW Pink Floyd welcome to the machine.  Should we wait for the party?  Alright we'll wait for the party sound effect.  The party sound effect?  There you go. 
[00:30]
 You too before that sweetest thing in ZZ Top 2.  It's Opi and Anthony.  Oi, how are you?  Pretty good.  Well are you enjoying winter's last blast Anthony?  Winter's last blast Opi.  You know we didn't quite get away scot free this winter.  No we didn't.  Let's go to the map.  The whole pressure system working its way across our area.  The weather geeks were just thrilled.  They were loving life weren't they?  So happy.  Every station calling it winter's last blast. 
[01:00]
 Winter's last blast Blizzard 99.  Because they were all bummed out that they didn't really have any fun with that.  What the hell was that man?  It just exploded.  Did you explode in the back of my head?  You just sneezed right on the back of your head man.  Come on.  I know how John F Kenny felt.  What the hell was that man?  The mucus came from the front and the side.  I saw his head go back first.  Well he was behind me and he was trying to hold it in and then all of a sudden I got  a little mucus on my rib cage. 
[01:30]
 Where's your girl to try to get the rest off the trunk?  Anyway the weather geeks thrilled to death that there was any kind of snow.  They've been hinting all year, all winter, saying could it be snow to our area?  Tune in at 11 and they go no.  No rain.  None.  But west of us, north and west of us, lots of snow. 
[02:00]
 In Canada.  So now we finally got some of the weather geeks were all thrilled.  Well they were giving out stupid weather tips today Anthony.  That's right.  You know when you're shoveling that snow, lift with your legs.  Don't take full shovels.  Look on the elderly.  Watch that ice people.  Watch out for the black ice.  Oh shut up.  A lot of limbs coming down.  Be careful of that.  Downed wires.  You see a downed wire.  Don't touch it for God's sake.  Call your power company.  But please don't approach downed wires. 
[02:30]
 When I see downed wires I feel like putting them in my hand and swinging them around.  Oh yeah.  No I plug them in my butt.  That's what I like to do.  Yeah.  Give me a break.  And then they show the same footage.  Oh the snow plows.  And then talking to the person that's driving in the snow.  Yeah it's a little rough but I'm taking my time.  You know the road's a little slippery.  Yeah obviously it's snowing out.  We're here on the Grand Central Parkway and this is Amy making her way to work.  Yeah it's a little slow you know traffic but what are you going to do? 
[03:00]
 It's winter.  What are you going to do?  Back to you at the studio.  Well good thing we're here in the warmth.  It's the same thing every year.  And then they got to talk to the plow truck driver.  Well we got an early start on this so we knew it was coming.  You got to thank the weather people really catching this one early.  So we got out there treated the roads with the chemicals.  Again they should just show footage from the 50s. 
[03:30]
 It's the same thing.  You know what I love about this weather though when we do get snow?  to work.  Will you shut up?  You're going to wreck it for everyone.  No you know what we're not going to wreck it all because they still are wussies and  it won't change.  Which is good I'm glad.  When it snows people say I can't drive.  So you only get the road warriors on the road.  It's the best day to drive into the city because there's not many cars and the people that  are driving usually know how to drive because they just plow out of their driveway and barreled 
[04:00]
 into work.  Yeah Ralph you drove today?  I didn't drive in no.  I barreled out of my driveway.  I was up over the fender you know.  I said I got to get to the train.  Train?  You take a train on a day like that where there's a crowd and everything.  They were saying 20 minutes to half hour system delays yada yada yada.  Rolling petri dishes.  I was on time.  I know the right models in Penn Station on the way in.  Who in their right mind shovels their driveway? 
[04:30]
 This snow is going to be gone tomorrow.  Just drive through it.  It's done.  Yeah like stock up on canned goods people.  Get a little snow.  You're going to want the canned goods and water.  Fill up your bathtub in case the power goes out.  You never knew that.  What are you going to lap out of your bathtub like the dog?  Right.  I've never turned on my faucet and had nothing come out when it snowed or anything.  I don't worry about filling up my bathtub.  Make sure the toilet tank is full if you want to drink out of that.  Like a little toilet cocktail because it's snowing. 
[05:00]
 Hi, N.E.W.  Yeah, how are you doing?  Good.  What time do you guys come on in the afternoon?  This doesn't sound good.  Three o'clock.  Three?  Yeah.  Three to what?  Seven.  Three to seven?  Okay.  Why did you make the remarks you made about JFK?  How old are you guys?  JFK?  Oh, this is because of the JFK remark?  I got a blast of mucus on the side of my head.  How old are you guys?  Does it matter?  I was not born when he was assassinated. 
[05:30]
 Why?  It sounds like it.  Wait a minute.  We were talking more of the assassination, not about him, about this brooder film and  not about him.  Do you know all the theories with it?  The head goes forward and back.  That's what we're joking about.  Not Kennedy dying.  Just because we mentioned Kennedy in the assassination, you're going to call up like we were ragging  Kennedy.  You can't even talk about the film anymore?  Go ahead.  You know, the fact that you guys weren't alive, perhaps...  It doesn't matter.  We weren't even talking about...  Would you listen? 
[06:00]
 Listen with more of an open ear.  You hear us say the name Kennedy and all of a sudden we're bashing Kennedy.  I can bash him now that you're on the phone.  He was a womanizer.  He was a cheat.  He was in his house.  He learned it from his old man.  And you guys think you could have been a pimple on his butt?  No, but...  You couldn't have.  You know something?  We weren't even...  I'll make sure that I turn off...  We weren't even bad-mouthing the man.  But since you're on, fine.  Bye-bye.  We lost another listener.  Bye-bye.  See you later.  Bay of Pigs.  What a debacle that was. 
[06:30]
 Get a real man in there.  He could have gotten Castro out.  The guy with his father all tied in with a mob.  Don't want to hear it.  We just lost a listener.  Guys, like a guy has him made up like a saint.  We just lost a listener.  Saint Jack Kennedy.  You should be sad.  We just lost a listener.  I don't care.  Ick, benign, asswipe.  The Rock of New York, 1027W and EW, click that subscribe button.  I'm going to be back.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  We're going to be at the bar back 57th and between eighth and ninth broadcast live this 
[07:00]
 Wednesday from three to seven.  So we want to see all the faithful listeners out there.  and have another great live broadcast.  Yes, we do. 
[07:30]
 The show is developing as we speak and it looks like it's going to be a lot of fun.  Well, St. Patty's Day is one of those days that are just fun regardless.  You know, we're going to be out in a bar.  So kind of hard to miss on that one.  And by the time three o'clock rolls around, I think everyone's going to be pretty liquored  up and they're not really going to pay attention to our radio show.  No, but we'll still have fun.  Yes.  What do you got over there?  Where are the kids still in here?  We got the bosses kids hanging with us tonight.  Interesting. 
[08:00]
 So I think this will be the G rated opiate Anthony show.  They look kind of look like the bosses only like fidget versions.  They look like the little Archie's.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or the little Flintstones.  When they did that.  Yeah.  Little Bugs Bunny cartoon.  They look like the bosses.  They kind of look like the bosses only smaller.  Yes.  Yeah.  Look at that.  It's a little Gary.  A little Scott.  Yeah.  Would you have a snow day guys?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Snow days rock.  Yeah. 
[08:30]
 Yeah.  You like school?  You're good in school?  No.  I'm good in school, but I don't like it.  You don't like it?  No.  What kid his age like school?  No one.  No, there are a few.  No.  Kiki wants.  What grade you in?  Fifth.  Yeah.  Fifth grade is when you start hating school.  Yeah.  It gets cool again in a few years though.  Trust me.  Yeah, but now it's boring.  Yeah.  School's boring, huh?  Yeah.  I understand.  I felt that way through my whole school career.  So you get a snow day and dad brings you to work, right? 
[09:00]
 Yep.  Yeah.  You got a crush on any of the girls in school?  No.  Not yet, huh?  They're all ugly.  Oh really?  Give them a couple years.  Yeah.  Well, that's interesting.  I like that the father bringing the kids in.  My dad did that.  I remember that when I was a kid.  Wait, your dad brought you to work?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Back, God, when was that?  I don't even remember.  Back in the early 70s, I guess. 
[09:30]
 Early 70s.  Yeah.  He was a private investigator.  I just never understood what he did because we used to go into his office and he talked  to the boss a little, thumbed through some papers, and then we'd be in a bar for the  whole day.  Get out of here.  Oh really?  No, I'm not kidding.  Like we'd just be in a bar and I'm like, I don't remember Mannix doing this.  This isn't what Cannon and Barnaby Jones do.  How come you're just drinking all day? 
[10:00]
 Dad, what do you do for a living?  Yeah, I didn't get it.  It's like, okay, we just sat there and I drank soda and he drank his scotch and I was thrilled  because I had peanuts that we could throw the shells on the floor.  And then at five o'clock he went home and he said, workday over.  That's it.  He went home and mom yelled at him.  It was great.  And he continued drinking at home, right?  No, because then he'd have to leave the house because mom would kick him out.  This guy knows Anthony's dad?  Really? 
[10:30]
 Come on.  Jimmy!  Hey, how you doing?  What's up?  Hey, I heard that Anthony's dad was Scott Muni and Anthony used to go into the show  and hang out all the time.  The drinking aspect.  Is that true?  You caught me.  Yes, I'm Anthony Muni.  All right, just a second.  Thanks guys.  Here's your son.  Here's your son.  We're going to drink.  We're going to teach you how to drink scotch.  So you having fun?  Who's that?  Scott's kid?  I can't even see him.  He's like, he's below the counter.  He's got the little wind shirt on and everything, a 10-10 wind shirt.  You having fun? 
[11:00]
 Yeah.  You like coming to work with dad?  Yeah.  Your dad's cool.  Yeah.  You like coming to work with dad?  Yeah.  You like coming to work with dad?  Yeah.  You like coming to work with dad?  Yeah.  You like coming to work with dad?  Yeah.  Yeah, your dad's a cool guy.  We like him.  Yeah, tell him to give us a raise.  Yeah, could you do that?  Go up there and say, give Opi and Anthony a raise.  Tell them they're the greatest and they need a raise.  Does he give you allowance?  Yeah.  Do you have an agent that negotiates that?  No. 
[11:30]
 Did you see that?  10% of his allowance has to go to his agent.  We got a good agent if you guys need it.  Yeah.  Okay.  We'll negotiate your allowance with your dads.  Okay.  We get 10% though.  Okay.  Yeah, we'll be your agents.  We'll negotiate your allowance.  How much money do we get?  How much do you get for an allowance?  Well, I get $20.  I want one.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Gary's kid gets, you get $20 a week?  Yeah.  If I feed the cats and everything.  Feed the cats?  Whoa!  But normally I get $10. 
[12:00]
 That's great.  I used to get a dollar a day.  I used to get $10 a week.  I used to get $10 a week.  I used to get $10 a week.  I used to get $10 a week.  I used to get $10 a week.  I used to get $10.  That's great.  I used to get a dollar, I think.  And you get a dollar?  Yeah.  Oh wow!  What a gym!  Now the big boss's kid gets a dollar a week and Gary's kid gets 20.  I think you're going to end up getting more money starting today.  You need the agents.  Call them up.  Let's get him more money. 
[12:30]
 We're going to get you more money right now.  Why do I need more money?  Yeah, we've got to call Scott in his office.  You're making 20.  You get 20 bucks a week.  I wish we made that at N.E.W.  20 bucks?  We're going to have to hook you up.  Now what do you do to get your dollar a week?  Nothing.  Oh wow.  He does nothing?  Wait a minute.  My dad owes me $10 already.  Does he?  But he forgets all the time.  Do you have to clean up your room or anything?  No.  No? 
[13:00]
 Maybe he just deserves a dollar a week.  I make things a little bit.  I used to get a dollar a week.  Can I take a picture with you?  Wow.  I used to get a dollar a week and I did everything.  A dollar a week?  I remember getting 50 cents or like a dime.  We're waiting to see if we can get Scott on the phone.  This is terrible.  Barely enough to go out and buy Razzles with.  We've got to find out why his kid only gets a dollar a week allowance.  Does he make you invest it in stocks and stuff?  My dad makes me put it all in the bank.  That's no fun.  No.  You never get to spend it on cool toys? 
[13:30]
 Yeah.  My mom pays for it.  Scott.  Alright, they're getting Scott.  I need a raise of money.  No, you've got enough money.  My dad threw it on the bank for college.  You've got enough.  You get 10 to 20 bucks a week.  Trust me, that's great.  I wish I would have gotten that kind of cake when I was a kid.  I feel sorry for Scott's kid.  What's your name again?  Greg.  Greg.  Greg.  Okay, Greg gets a dollar.  We're going to get you a raise today.  Yeah, we'll get you more money.  Cool.  Because that's like a jiff.  Your dad's doing pretty good, you know.  I'm going to go get him a little bit of a raise.  I'm going to go get him a little bit of a raise.  You know how much Gary's kid gets a week? 
[14:00]
 How much?  Twenty dollars a week.  If I'm extra good.  That's why I negotiated your contract that Gary didn't.  That makes sense.  I told you I'm a tough negotiator.  I was serious.  I'm telling your kid Greg that we've got a good agent. 
[14:30]
 We're going to renegotiate his allowance for him.  But we're doing that now and we're going to take 10 percent.  Could you ask him what he does for the dollar?  Yeah, he said nothing.  He said nothing.  Exactly.  He owned up to it.  Oh, come on.  He brings joy into your life.  That's what's worth about a dollar.  How old are you, Greg?  I'm seven.  Seven?  Well, seven years old.  A dollar?  That's like insulting.  Well, you know, my rule used to be that you get a dollar a grade.  Yeah?  And he had a first grade.  So when he's in 12th, he finally gets 12th? 
[15:00]
 That's why we're getting three bucks a week.  We're like third graders in here.  Oh, wow.  I think he got a raise recently.  Why?  Oh, you did?  I think he was getting 50 cents.  Fifty cents?  He doesn't pay for anything anyway.  What do you think he is, Huck Finn?  Come on.  We went out for lunch today.  He got a hard rock t-shirt.  Yeah, that's nice.  He doesn't pay for anything.  But yeah, you're a kid.  You need some cash to buy cool toys that your parents don't understand. 
[15:30]
 Why don't you ask him what the last thing he spent money on was?  What was it, Greg?  He doesn't remember.  He can't afford anything.  Yeah, because he's broke.  Oh, man.  I don't know.  Two bucks sounds pretty good.  How much allowance do you guys give Rick?  Not much.  Come on, fess up two bucks for the kid.  Hey, give him two bucks.  Two bucks?  I think his sister gets three bucks.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Come on, you're like a big GM.  But she's in fifth grade.  Well, you're going to have to give her a little extra money.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[16:00]
 I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Oh, well, you're going to have to give her a raise too then.  She should be making five bucks then.  Yeah.  If your grade, little grade scheme.  Yeah, I sort of threw that out there when she got to fourth grade.  I think my eighth grade is getting six bucks.  Oh, you got to upgrade all three of them.  You think?  Yeah, your little kid needs money.  It's more than a dollar.  I don't have any money in my pocket. 
[16:30]
 You're going to insult him.  He's going to get a complex only getting a dollar.  What did he say?  Well, that's scary.  He wants more and he's already getting ten to twenty bucks.  What is he buying?  Yeah, what do you buy with your money?  My dad puts it all in the bank.  Stock options.  He buys all his things.  He's the single largest infinity stockholder.  Well, yeah, I think two bucks would be good.  Yeah, he seems kind of bummed.  He only gets a dollar.  Okay, well, tell him I'll talk to him about it when he comes upstairs. 
[17:00]
 All right.  Uh-oh.  We got him in trouble.  We got him in trouble.  He's going to say, Greg, never go on the air with those two boys again.  All right, Scott.  Okay, thanks, guys.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Yeah, I think he'll come through.  Two bucks.  Keep hitting him with it.  Keep saying two bucks.  Let us know if he gives you the extra dollar, Greg. 
[17:30]
 Yeah, a lot of people call and say they saw Reverend Al on the front row.  There he was.  All right, buddy.  All right, listen, man.  Take care, guys.  Thanks.  Bye-bye.  There you have it.  What a farce.  Man, unbelievable.  Don King.  Yeah, they ought to throw him out of boxing.  Of course.  It'll never happen, though.  No.  He brings in so much money for the sport.  It'll never happen. 
[18:00]
 Unbelievable.  The guy makes sense, though.  He didn't want the world championship out of his hands.  He didn't want it out of his hands.  How much more money does Don King need at this point, anyway?  I don't know.  So, get Vince McMahon in.  Like I said, just get him in charge of it.  Write it off for what it is.  Sports entertainment.  Vince McMahon, it's sports entertainment.  You could have Lewis and Holyfield rematch on Raw's War tonight.  Yeah.  Lennox Lewis, Evander Holyfield, Kane and The Rock in a four-man cage anal-fisting match 
[18:30]
 with the gloves on.  Special guest referee, Mankind.  It would be entertaining.  Yeah.  Hey, Nick, what do you got?  Dude, Don King ruined boxing.  Oh, please.  He definitely did.  Of course.  He's the worst guy.  Well, he ruined it years ago, though.  He did.  I mean, the only thing the guy's got going is a bad hair stylist and he's got a dictionary 
[19:00]
 and he learned some big words and he ruined boxing.  Well, that's why the last caller asked if I saw the fight.  I said, no.  I used to be a huge boxing fan.  I'm not into it anymore, you know?  Yeah.  And the sad part is, Don King is going to get his rematch with Lewis and Holyfield,  and every single one of us that bought the fight Saturday night will buy it again.  Exactly.  And that's the whole reason he's doing it, to make more money.  Exactly. 
[19:30]
 And we don't see that.  We'll just go, okay, okay, another pay-per-view.  All right, I'll pay my money.  Exactly.  I'm stupid.  I'm a doofus, but I'll watch.  Exactly.  You know?  What are you going to tell?  How about this Don King quote?  This is really a quote from him.  It's entertainment, baby.  You love my black ass because I'm exciting.  This guy's out of his mind.  Yeah, he's shy.  He's shy.  Well, we're more pathetic than Don King because we'll all buy the second fight now. 
[20:00]
 Yeah, well, I got the cable box, so I'm good.  Oh, there you go.  But if you want to protest, just don't buy the next pay-per-view.  Oh, stop.  Mr. protest basketball the same way, I'll think.  Well, I...  Wait, but I don't watch as much as I used to.  All right.  That's the key to that.  I think because it's not interesting.  Basketball's even worse to watch.  Huh?  Basketball's even worse to watch.  You've got a ten-foot net with eight-foot guys with no defense.  What is that?  Well, there's a lot of... if you really want to get into basketball, there's too much defense  this year.  No one's scoring this year, but that's next. 
[20:30]
 Whatever.  Don King takes fighters and he chews them up of all they're worth, he packs as much  cash as he can, and then he spits them out the other side and doesn't care about them,  and he goes along his merry way.  He's like, look what he did to Tyson.  He had his whole family on Tyson's payroll.  Oh, I know.  He went to jail.  He didn't have a dime.  Oh, yeah.  This guy's raping these guys, man.  He's just raping them blind, and then they get spit out the other end of the Adon King  machine broke, owing to all kinds of tax money, and a lot of times they can't pay that. 
[21:00]
 They're destitute, bankrupt, and he goes skipping off.  Mr. Manslaughter.  You know what I'll pay for him and Reverend Al going at him?  That'd be fun.  That'd be good.  In a fisting match.  In all fairness, if Holyfield and Tyson fight again, I would have to watch that.  Holyfield and Tyson?  Yeah, I'm not going to lie.  Just to see what Tyson will do next.  Yeah, I'd pay for that.  All right, man.  We've got to fly.  Later, dude.  Thanks. 
[21:30]
 Bye-bye.  But now that would be for the freak show factor, not for the...  Yeah, pretty much, because Tyson's just rated at completely explode.  Yeah.  While we're on sports, yes, the Nets did fire Calipari today.  This is interesting, huh?  It's just, whatever.  It's not his fault.  The season is a sham.  Half his team is hurt.  Yeah, it's kind of strange they ditch him during this season.  And it looks like Van Gundy's next.  Rumors circulating that they're going to fire him as well.  Oh.  Well, you've got to give them a lot of credit. 
[22:00]
 What a fix on that fight last night.  Yeah.  Obviously, Lennox Lewis...  Lennox Lewis.  Lennox Lewis.  Lennox Lewis.  ...should have won that fight.  Yeah.  They considered it a draw.  You think they're talking about that today on the fan?  Grandma got her diddies caught in the ringer.  There are plenty of goodies and limited edition N.E.W. Killian's T-shirts.  For more info, just log on to www.wnew.com. 
[22:30]
 It's all from Killian's Irish Red, the official beer of St. Patrick's Day.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW Metallica, Whiskey in the Jar from Karajink.  It's Opi and Anthony.  Hey, thanks for hanging with us today.  We appreciate that.  Yes, we do.  Getting lots of instant feedback today.  Seems like a lot of people didn't go to work today.  Yeah, yeah, well, kind of a snow day.  People take them throughout the winter.  We haven't really had any bad snow days, so I think people took advantage, Opi. 
[23:00]
 You're right.  The last blast of winter, everyone.  I've only heard that statement about 100 times today.  That's it.  Come on.  Freely.  We didn't get off that easy now, did we?  Back to you with the studio.  And then the weather channel's got to put that poor guy, that poor sap out in the weather,  no matter where it's snowing in the big cold.  I'm here on the side of the Jersey turnpike.  The snow changing over to rain.  You can't do that for the studio?  With a camera somewhere?  We've all seen it snow, yes. 
[23:30]
 We're not retards.  But this guy writes, Hey, I got a big F you to all the people on the road today in an SUV who feel because it's bad weather.  They can drive super, super fast and aggressive and all but knock off the road.  A schmuck's trying to get to work in our piece of garbage compact cars.  Can you give us our one day?  I can't agree with that F you.  I can't either.  Nope.  Can't agree.  You know why? 
[24:00]
 That guy writing that email probably was in the left lane, probably in the fast lane, doing 50 miles an hour because the road is wet.  It's not icy.  It's wet.  But then people still drive 50 miles an hour just because the road's wet.  Yeah.  I mean, we get these SUVs and we want to see what it could do.  And we only get a chance to check out what it could do maybe a few times a year now.  And think for your own benefit.  OK.  For your own benefit.  Let us go fast because think of the chuckles you get when you're around the corner and see one rolled over in a ditch. 
[24:30]
 Come on, you'll laugh, right?  You're looking up.  See?  So if you let us go fast, more of us will roll into ditches and you'll be able to laugh at us.  Yeah, please let us have our fun.  Get out of the way.  Let us have our fun.  Spring's on the way and we weren't able to see what this could do in the snow this year.  John from the Island writes, Hey guys, saw you guys at the Farmingdale movie theater on Saturday night.  I didn't say hi because I figured you didn't want the attention on your time off the air. 
[25:00]
 Just wondering what movie you guys saw.  I saw 8mm with Nicolas Cage.  Love the show.  Keep up the good work.  John, you're going to bother us.  What do you think?  We're like movie stars.  You see us out and about.  Come up and say hi.  He got the rare double sighting, Ophi.  Yeah.  We hung out a lot this weekend.  Yeah.  Lately, we blow each other off on weekends.  Well, you know how it is.  You got to hang out with the girls and stuff.  Well, we double dated.  Yes, we did the double date.  Jennifer and Sandy took them to the movies.  And we saw 8mm as well, John. 
[25:30]
 That movie blew.  Man.  I was so disappointed in that movie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That Nicolas Cage.  Don't worry about making plans on Oscar night.  No.  Don't worry about that.  No.  He has got to be the worst actor.  I've never liked Nicolas Cage.  And this movie really shows it.  I'm extremely upset.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I'm extremely happy. 
[26:00]
 Yeah.  Wow.  Look at that.  Same emotion.  Look at the wave that he...  Just bad.  The movie...  It had so many...  I didn't even get it.  No, it had potential, but it was just so predictable.  And I don't know.  He's watching this film getting all skeeved out because it's a snuff film of this girl  getting killed after some sex and stuff.  And I'm watching going, this ain't bad.  They show him in the seat cringing like a la George C. Scott in Hardcore.  Turn it off. 
[26:30]
 Turn it off.  I'm watching his daughter in the movie.  That was good.  But yeah, he's watching this and he's cringing.  I'm like, come on.  I can go for some more.  Give us some good stuff.  Because they really weren't showing anything bad that he should be cringing over.  And then another part of the movie, he's in this, the seedy part of the city where they're  doing these like back alley porno swap meets it looked like.  It looked like a big garage sale of smut.  Yeah, it was underground porn.  Stuff you can't just buy in stores. 
[27:00]
 Like the real good stuff.  And he's going into these tents where they're showing these movies and the guy's spanking  and there's a chick doing something to a guy and he's looking all like, oh, this is horrible.  This is the most awful thing I've ever seen in my life.  I can't go on with these images in my head.  And I'm looking, where's this place?  Yeah, I want to take this out of the movie.  Instead of going to a stupid movie, I want to be in that place.  Where's the underground smart mall?  I want to go.  Why not? 
[27:30]
 This is awful.  I don't think I'll be able to go to my wife and kid.  He's the worst.  He really is.  I've never been a fan of his and this movie was just, it was horrible.  You know who was good in it?  The guy that plays Tony Soprano on The Sopranos.  He played one of the smut peddler guys.  He was good.  With his raw language.  Oh, that's great.  I love that crap.  You can't beat cursing in movies.  I love it.  Hi, N.E.W.  You guys read my mind.  That was pure steaming crap when he was watching that snuff film. 
[28:00]
 That dumb look on his face.  I mean, come on, you could practically rent that movie a blockbuster.  I know.  There was nothing shocking in there.  He was like, oh, oh, oh.  He's supposed to look on his face.  I think he was constipated or something.  That's what he sounded like.  He's squirming in the seat.  At one point, the guy in the mask smacks her and he goes, oh.  Like he lets out this groaning grunt.  It's like, you can see that anywhere.  You know what it was.  You couldn't see a hand in that scene so maybe he was just spanking it.  Who knows?  Maybe.  You see worse on Springer.  You know, on Jerry Springer.  So where's violence?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[28:30]
 I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[29:00]
 I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[29:30]
 I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[30:00]
 I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  But thank God the people at the snack bar work fast. 
[30:30]
 So the lines aren't really long and they move very quickly.  Because I don't know how they get that popcorn in the big popcorn tub so quickly.  It being such a difficult job.  I don't know why it doesn't take them longer.  And why is the popcorn so big?  Do you need that much popcorn?  You need a wheelbarrow to bring it to your seat.  Elaine, look at the size of this popcorn.  Come on.  I have the big 55 gallon drum of soda. 
[31:00]
 George, why do we need so much popcorn?  I wouldn't use this much popcorn if I was packing fragile items.  Why do I need so much beverage?  Could I eat this many jujubes?  I could pull out every tooth.  Framer, look at all this popcorn.  Hey, what do you got, man?  Hey guys, what's going on? 
[31:30]
 Hey, what do you got?  Well, I saw the movie over the weekend just like you guys did.  I thought it sucked.  Oh yeah, horrendously.  I thought it was a waste of $8.  Oh, without a doubt.  Pretty bad.  One thing that I found out, I don't know if you guys noticed it, there was a camera mistake.  Oh, a film flub.  We love these.  It turned off towards the end of the movie.  We love film flubs.  What was it?  When they were at that crappy summer house that they stayed at and he went out. 
[32:00]
 Go to the place we went on the Fourth of July.  Right.  When he went back, the wife was laying on the bed and she got up and they started talking  and the baby was laying on the bed where she was.  He was laying right on top of the staircase.  Oh yeah, I kind of saw that and was wondering if that was a mistake.  I turned to my friend and I said it to her.  I was like, what was she doing, laying on top of the thing?  Yeah, if it was a good movie you wouldn't even notice.  I know, I was going to say if it was a good movie you wouldn't be looking for continuity  errors.  What the what?  Continuity errors, thank you. 
[32:30]
 Sorry about that.  And we passed by the little cemetery and house that the masked guy lived at right off the  expressway there.  Yeah, because that's another thing you notice too.  It's like, hey wait, that's the LIE.  Yeah, it was right by Utopia Parkway.  Yeah, we're looking like and then we both point, that's the house right there.  That's kind of cool.  Yeah.  All right, man.  All right, take care guys.  Thanks.  Bye.  Oh, real fast, Ant?  Yeah.  Sandy and I thought that your breath stunk at the movie. 
[33:00]
 I got to keep telling something.  Well, Jen thought it was your breath.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, we're in the theater and someone had like a dog breath.  I mean, it smelled like stale beer breath.  It's horrible.  And I kept looking behind me going, man, who's got the bad breath?  And then I'm whispering to Sandy, now Sandy's convinced it was either your leather jacket  or your breath.  Brand new leather jacket.  For God's sake.  I don't stink.  I shower every day.  It's getting liquor down in the movie.  Well, that's another thing too.  It turned out to be what?  A horrible movie.  What?  No, no, the smell. 
[33:30]
 Oh, okay.  Well, getting back to that.  So then we're leaving.  We're like, what the hell was that, man?  Was that Anthony's breath?  Was it his leather jacket?  Yeah.  And then we're like, oh, I'm going to go to the theater.  I'm going to go to the theater.  I'm going to go to the theater.  What was that, man?  Was that Anthony's breath?  Was it his leather?  Was it someone sitting behind us?  Turns out, Sam had dog crap on her shoe.  On her shoe.  Yeah.  So Sandy stunk.  Yeah.  Wasn't basically.  Wasn't us.  Because we were Jen goes, oh my God, someone stinks.  Like we thought it stunk.  And the whole atmosphere of the theater now is getting out of control.  First of all, some dope brought a two year old into the theater. 
[34:00]
 To see 8 millimeter.  A baby is there going, and everyone's turned around.  Oh, geez.  Why would you bring a kid like that to a movie?  I'm sorry if you can't get a babysitter or a canceled or something, but don't wreck it  for everyone else.  Then the people behind us.  Cell phone going off.  Someone's frigging cell phone is going at the movie.  You're trying to watch.  It's like, I can't rewind this.  Could you not do this? 
[34:30]
 So yeah, I drink at the movies.  Me and Jen, I think I still have it.  Wait a minute.  And had the little silver flask.  There it is.  What's wrong with you, man?  What's wrong with you, man?  And my little silver flask.  I fill it up with Captain Morgan.  And me and Jen get a couple of large cokes.  And we pour it in.  Why can't you enjoy a cocktail at the movies?  What's wrong with you guys?  You go to a Broadway show.  What happens at intermission?  You go out, you get a cocktail, you come back.  What's the difference with a movie?  And with the people going to movies these days with their kids, I have to drink. 
[35:00]
 Most people, though, they'll sit through a two hour movie, get a drink afterward or whatever.  If you can, why not?  I'm enjoying a cocktail.  Rick, you too?  See?  You're the worst.  No, I haven't done it recently.  Yeah.  But I got thrown out of a movie.  Did you?  For bringing a bottle in.  Well, you don't bring a bottle.  We had the bottle in.  It was like halfway through the movie.  We had our little cups.  And we're just sitting back enjoying all of a sudden the flashlight.  Poof!  But it's not like you guys are 17, 18 years old. 
[35:30]
 You're like grown men.  That's why I bring it in a little flask.  You can flask into the movie theater.  No, and then you just spice up your coke.  I mean, what's the problem?  You would drink if you go to a club to see a live performance.  You would drink if you go to Broadway during intermission.  You come out.  It's Saturday night.  I'm at the movies.  I'm going to be there a couple of hours.  Why not?  You dip it in.  They should sell it at the snack bar.  I was just going to say, then, why don't they sell beer right at the snack bar?  Oh, please.  Those people can't feel our popcorn. 
[36:00]
 You want butter in your Jack and Coke?  Shut up.  Hi, NW.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Hey, what's up?  Listen, I saw the movie a couple of weeks ago when it first came out.  Eight millimeter.  Right.  Now, you guys are from the island, right?  Yeah.  Now, I live in Queens and I went to the Green Acres movie, Simplex.  Right.  You know, 15th-day.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's huge.  You got to go through the metal detect and everything.  But it's predominantly black.  Right.  I would say eight out of ten people in front of me, yo, babe, let me get a ticket for nine 
[36:30]
 millimeter, man.  Nine millimeter?  Nine millimeter.  You know what's on their mind.  I am the only white guy in the theater and I'm like, oh, jeez, I hope nobody got eight  millimeter to go kill me, wit.  Hey, you're just lucky.  You're just, you should consider yourself, oh, this is going to be bad, but you should  consider yourself lucky that it wasn't a good movie because then they would have to pop  some caps into the screen.  Oh, forget it.  Then I would have just ducked down and just called them and said, hey, don't hurt me.  Don't hurt me, please.  That's an old Chris Rock joke.  Right. 
[37:00]
 He talks about how like, you know, but the movie's so good, you know, in the hood, the  brothers have to pop us some caps in the screen.  As long as I wasn't sitting in the front.  I sat in the back, but it was just funny.  I'm like, yeah, we know the mentality that you have now.  Right.  And every time they correct it, no, eight millimeter.  Yeah, eight millimeter, whatever.  Whatever.  Give me a damn ticket and shut up.  But the movie did, the movie did suck.  Yeah.  It's a waste of money and he's got to get some, he played, he reminds me of Ricky, Mickey  Rock now.  Yeah.  Those real seedy scumbag roles. 
[37:30]
 Right, right, right.  Oh, can I say that?  Well, I heard it.  His acting ability is just horrendous.  Sorry.  All right, buddy.  Be good, guys.  Thank you.  Later.  I'm sorry.  You felt nothing for any of the characters.  It's just an awful movie.  Yeah, we had fun though.  I have no problem with bringing in a little beverage into the movie theater.  I think you'd find a lot of people probably do that, Opie.  Drive in, brings it cooler and gets wasted.  Yeah, that's the drive in though.  The drive in, right?  Remember the drive ins?  I don't know those anymore, Opie.  Hey, Bob.  Bob. 
[38:00]
 Yes, sir?  Yeah, drive in?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  I love drive ins.  Yeah, you bring the cooler and get wasted there.  I can see that.  It's a nice summer night and stuff.  It's not like Jen's distracting the ticket guy while I roll the keg past, Opie.  No.  I just like a little cocktail for a...  Cooler it, put a blanket over it and so where somebody's sitting on it, drink as much beer  as you want because they don't sell it there and we always bring our own food in too.  That's the drive in.  You had your friends in the trunk too with the drive in.  We used to do that.  Not anymore.  All right, no more drive ins.  All right, brother. 
[38:30]
 Thanks.  Thanks, Bob.  I liked before they figured out that you could do it with the radio, with the drive in screen.  Remember then you tuned to 58 or whatever and you get the movie on your stereo and you  had those big clunky speakers you have to put on and every so often someone would drive  off with it.  Oh, I...  Pull it out of the window and come popping out.  Every weekend because you were hammered, you hadn't forgotten you had the damn thing on  the, you know...  Get a bunch of people hammered to drive through a course with these big metal posts sticking 
[39:00]
 up everywhere.  Kids running around in pajamas.  All right, we got to take a quick break here.  The Rock of New York, 1027WNEW.  It's open, Anthony.  Got something for the show, 212-757-1027 or you can fax us the fax number, 212-957-WNEW  and Paul the lawyer, one of our faves from Jersey, has another fax.  I love his faxes when they're about you.  Well, Paul is so faithful to our show that he really starts picking up on things. 
[39:30]
 He's very observant.  Very observant and he puts together a list and stuff about our show and things that we  have said and he keeps track of pretty much everything.  Okay.  Well, he's got another list, Anthony.  Things we will never hear Anthony say on the radio.  Number one, WNEW, The Rock of New York.  That's all things lying.  Well, I just start every break. 
[40:00]
 I think it would be kind of weird if we came out of ACDC and you started the break.  I'll put on my DJ voice.  WNEW, The Rock of New York.  I mean, you could do it.  Number two, things you'll never hear Anthony say, the mayor is dead.  Yeah, that's true.  Well, you agreed to that, Frank.  You called very early in the morning in Boston and we had a job up there and said, yeah,  I've got a great April Fool's prank. 
[40:30]
 We'll say the mayor is dead.  I'm like, what?  Yeah, okay, okay, yeah, sure, yeah, whatever.  Click.  Before you know it, we're fired.  Yeah, you probably won't hear me ever say that.  All right, I guess three goes with two.  Why yes, Opie, that's a great idea.  Yeah, exactly.  Things we'll never hear Anthony say.  We go visit your Annie Mar in Boston.  You have to be listening for a very long time to get that one.  That's funny.  Yeah, Annie Mar.  And hates when he has to do the road trip to see the relatives up in Boston. 
[41:00]
 Yeah.  Well, Jen's relatives, yours by marriage, obviously.  All right, number five, things you'll never hear Anthony say.  Opie, shame on you.  You should show Carol more respect.  Right, okay.  I hear chuckles from the peanut gallery.  Okay.  Six, Tara, please put your clothes back on.  Yeah.  You are a pervert.  I'm getting there to take them off of the camera, sure.  Now, what's going on with the women challenging Tara? 
[41:30]
 No one has come forth.  No, everybody that checks out Tara's pictures, we just haven't talked about it in a while  because, you know, it's getting old to talk about.  But the pictures are still up there and we keep getting emails from girls going,  she's the hottest, I blow her away, blah, blah, blah, whatever.  But any girls who have seen Tara's picture on the website or seen her live that think  that our audience will think she is more attractive than Tara, come down and do a little photo  shoot, we'll put your pictures on the website and the fans will decide if you should be 
[42:00]
 crowned the hottest chick to take her clothes off on the Opie and Anthony show.  Well, why don't we set it up for Friday?  Let's get a couple competitors.  All right, we'll do that.  Let's put the word out right now.  We are looking for someone to take Tara out.  Hot girls.  Hot girls.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, Van Halen and the Doors.  You're hanging with Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  Hello, hello, hello.  Quickly, some show news really fast.  First of all, I want to thank everyone who sent in feedback about our show. 
[42:30]
 We've read every single one of your emails.  Yeah.  We're not going to be able to write everyone back, but we're definitely reading everything  you guys send in.  We just want to let you know that and thanks for helping us out.  There's a survey thing on the WNEW website under our pictures where you can write about  the show and stuff.  We're trying to figure out what you guys like about the show, what you don't like, blah,  blah, blah.  It's very interesting stuff you guys have sent in.  So thank you for that. 
[43:00]
 Secondly, this coming Wednesday we're broadcasting live at Le Barbat on 57th and between 8th  and 9th.  Great location for St. Patty's Day and we're inviting all you F'ers to come hang out with  us.  It's going to be unbelievable.  So make your plans.  This Wednesday, broadcasting live at Le Barbat, 57th between 8th and 9th.  We'll be there from 3 to whenever.  Right.  I've got to point out a stupid observation. 
[43:30]
 What do you got?  Well, I watch a lot of TV before I come in.  Right.  News teases.  The news tease?  Anyone else with me on the news teases where they try to rookie in to watch the noon news  or the 5 o'clock news or the 11 o'clock news?  I heard the stupidest news tease today.  Coming up at noon, new hope for Alzheimer's patients.  Details at noon. 
[44:00]
 How ridiculous is that?  Oh boy, thank goodness.  New hope.  If you got the new hope for the Alzheimer's patients, don't you think you should give  them that information now?  There was something I wanted to watch at noon.  But I can't remember.  Right.  I seemed to have forgotten.  And I hate the teases in general, but that one was like, come on, now you guys are completely  ridiculous.  But they scare the you-know-what at you. 
[44:30]
 Yeah, and you'd think if it was that important, they'd break in, tell you now.  And I think the parents ought to be a little peeved too at some of these things.  Popular playpen kills children.  Tune in at noon.  And we'll tell you which one.  Meanwhile, your kid's like playing in a playpen or something.  Right.  Or they do it with like dangerous toys.  Yeah.  A toy that your toddler's playing with, could it be harmful to his health?  Tune in at 11.  We'll let you know what toy it is.  Why don't you tell me now?  My kid is playing with a hundred toys in the next room.  You know?  Escape convict.  Could he be wandering in your neighborhood? 
[45:00]
 Well, tell me now.  My kids are outside.  You know?  Ford recalling vehicles, wheels fall off.  Right.  Could you just maybe get the model name out there, please?  Popular lunch meat.  Could kill you.  Deadly.  Right.  Deadly burgers on your grill.  Like in the summer, you know?  Yeah.  Deadly barbecue at noon.  A burger recall.  Dead noon.  Well, hello? 
[45:30]
 That's what we just had for lunch.  Should I rush to the hospital?  Some water in certain pounds kill instantly.  Yeah.  At noon.  Exploding refrigerators.  The best, though, is with the toys that your kids could possibly be playing with in the next room.  But that was amazing today.  Coming up at noon, new hope for Alzheimer's patients.  Details at noon.  I got to remember to tune in to that.  What was it? 
[46:00]
 All right.  And now what's going on with the otters?  Well, Opie, this has human being written all over it.  Beloved park pets that bit Bronx toddler in Florida spared deadly rabies tests.  Yeah, that was a big story.  Little Rachel Gold was with her family in Florida, and they were looking at the cute little otters playing and frolicking.  And they went into this area they weren't supposed to be in. 
[46:30]
 And the kid was able to put her hand through the fence.  And a little otter came up and did what otters do.  Bite people.  They might look cute, but they're bitter.  And then it scurries off.  So they can't tell which one of these otters bit the kid.  So they have to do rabies tests on all the otters.  This entails examining the otter's brain.  That's how you do rabies tests.  You've got to cut open their head and pop their brain out.  I guess you can't do that when they're alive. 
[47:00]
 No, no, certain humans you can do that on.  No, not little otters.  So they would have to kill the otters.  Or the kid could go through these series of shots.  And then the otters could live.  Just, you know, head the rabies off the path.  Because once rabies takes hold, you die.  Once you start getting symptoms.  So if the kid starts having symptoms and then they give the treatment, the kid will die.  So they can't take any chances.  So the father goes, well, my kid's two years old, whatever it is. 
[47:30]
 I'm not going to have her undergo these shots unless she needs them.  Kill the otters.  Well, it will be the outcry from people that saw the news clip of the cute, furry little creatures scurrying.  You know how they do that little float thing on their back and break open the little shells on their tummy.  And eat whatever they're eating.  And they smile and wave.  They're very cute animals.  Well, the people went a bull crap and called up.  And then the guy changed his mind and said the kid will undergo the shots. 
[48:00]
 We will not kill the otters.  Yes.  That's so funny.  It is.  Because you know, if a rat bit that kid, we'd be killing the rats.  Of course. There wouldn't even be a question about it.  It's a no-brainer, you know.  If a little chicken came over and pecked the kid and they thought the chicken had something, they would kill the chicken.  Or a big ugly possum.  You ever see possums? They look like huge rats.  Dead.  Dead.  How about a raccoon?  Um, almost cute.  No, cute.  Save the raccoon.  Okay, you scared me there with your theory. 
[48:30]
 No. People are hysterical because they are cute animals.  So are you not being biased to the visual aspect of the animal?  You don't care that it is just a living, breathing creature.  You care that it's cute.  It has to be cute.  To save it.  That's why people are, a large majority of these people are hypocrites.  We like pointing out hypocrisy here.  We are human beings, top of the food chain.  We should be able to do what the hell we want with the resources on this planet. 
[49:00]
 Because if we do things that don't jive with the planet, we will be extinct.  So it doesn't matter.  If a spaceship came down and we looked tasty...  Well, they're going to eat the fat people first.  Well, that's what I hear.  Do you think we wouldn't be on the menu?  Of course we would.  We're so pompous.  So it's like, all right, save the otter.  Yes, we can't kill the otter.  Cut the damn things heads open.  Check.  You know what the little kid going under these shots if she doesn't have to.  But because the otter is cute, I'll be. 
[49:30]
 Speedpass can be linked to any major credit card or check card you already have.  Mobile Speedpass, the fastest way to get gas.  All right.  What?  Room is down empty.  Available at stations equipped with Speedpass technology.  Anthony MapQuest, sorry.  I can believe I believe I can fly.  I hate that song.  Sorry.  Why?  I got distracted.  Did it have something to do with anything that happened? 
[50:00]
 No, it's just such a gay song.  MapQuest.com, Anthony.  Sorry.  Well, if you're going in...  You turn my mic off, Opie.  How am I supposed to talk about MapQuest?  All right, take three.  Anthony, MapQuest.com.  If you will be going anywhere.  I'll look at the time.  Their time is over.  MapQuest time.  Go ahead, sorry.  I like to pop up MapQuest.com at home before I go anywhere, print out a map, a visual map, 
[50:30]
 and text directions step by step, street by street, mile by mile of where I want to go.  From my point of departure to my destination, everything printed out.  So there's no mistakes.  I don't have to go to the gas station.  I don't have to go to the 7-Eleven and try to ask the guy for directions.  Go left to the right, make left, turn around, when you see Allah, make left.  Can't take it anymore. 
[51:00]
 You ask for directions?  No.  I refuse to ask for directions.  Not anymore.  I'm a typical guy.  I would rather drive around in circles for an hour than pull over and ask for directions.  I just can't do it.  You don't have to do either of those when you visit MapQuest.com first.  Anywhere you want to go in the United States, you have a long trip to take.  You can plot it out with MapQuest.  You have a short little trip to the store.  You want to know a faster way to get to work, pop it in.  And you get, like I said, a map, a genuine map, and printed out directions. 
[51:30]
 It's free.  It's easy.  It's on your little home computer.  It'll tell you how long you'll be on each road.  I like the details of that.  It's pretty cool.  I guess.  Because when someone gives you directions, they go, well, take a ride on Smith Street,  and then off for Washington Street.  And you're like, well, how long do I have to be on Smith Street?  You got the line of people behind you because you got to slow down at every turn.  You don't get this with MapQuest.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, Allman Brothers, Whipping Posts.  They got, what, 20 more dates left at the beacon or something like that? 
[52:00]
 Is that it?  I don't know.  The next time they play is the 19th, the 20th, 26th, the 27th.  Oh, no, they play the 16th.  Oh, wow.  They're playing tonight as well.  Now I'm just confused.  Well, look at how they put it on the board there.  I know.  They scratched out some of the ones they've done already.  I guess basically there's tickets still available for tonight's show is what they're trying to say.  And then they play tomorrow night, tickets still available for that show. 
[52:30]
 Whatever.  Just call the beacon.  There's so many dates with the Allman Brothers.  Ladies before that from Tom Petty, Free Girl Now.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, man.  What's up?  Sam.  We got a PSA here.  Yeah, this is pretty good.  It's Rudy.  Mm-hmm.  Giuliani.  He's talking about his new tough drunk driving policy.  Yes.  I guess they're running these public service announcements all over radio.  And we've noticed his lisp is really bad in this. 
[53:00]
 I'm having a hard time listening to what he's saying because he's slurring his words so bad.  The mayor, the good mayor, has two distinct lisps.  One is the spitting lisp, the kind of lispy thing like this that affects his S's.  Then he's almost got the Tom Brokaw L problem with a lot of line, gling, gling.  So combine these two.  You have a cartoon character. 
[53:30]
 You really do.  I definitely love loved ones that love this law.  I don't understand.  He can't talk.  Well, let's play the PSA, Anthony.  Let's listen along.  Obviously a serious subject.  We know that.  Of course.  Well, maybe they should have got someone else to do the voiceover.  Serious subject, stupid law.  Yeah, because all I'm picturing in my head as I listen to the mayor is Simon Barcinister. 
[54:00]
 And then I'll build a weather machine and rule the world.  With his big beluga whale head, bar head.  What's that hair do?  What do you mean?  The mayor.  Now is it a bad hair piece or is he doing the comb over?  That is not a hair piece.  He's definitely doing the comb over, but he doesn't have much left to comb over.  I guess being his honor is taking its toll on his hair. 
[54:30]
 So he's got, he's swirling it now like a Carvel cone.  Like a Mr. Softie.  Yeah.  I mean, look at it.  It's getting to the point where he's one of those guys that have three strands.  You see those guys?  Yeah.  They get three strands of hair and comb it over.  Why bother?  The best is those guys in Windstorm and you see their three hairs, it goes halfway down.  It's flops down.  Yeah.  Flops down past their shoulder.  You know, when it gets to that point, why bother?  Yeah.  Just let it go. 
[55:00]
 Let it go.  I mean, but he's got three hairs.  I don't know.  He's going to have three hairs.  Now it just looks like he's got that dog crap hair do.  It just looks like a dog crap on his head.  Let me say, it also kind of has that G.I. Joe look too.  It's just kind of plastered on.  Plastic.  Yeah, because it's very plastered down.  Yeah.  Almost like a Mr. Potato Head snap-on thing.  The big Simon Vaughn sinister head.  All right.  You want to listen to the PSA from the mayor?  Yeah, notice his lisp is definitely getting worse. 
[55:30]
 All right, let's take a listen.  For years you've heard the call not to drink and drive, but despite the outcry, hundreds  of New Yorkers are killed every year by drunk drivers.  Yes.  It's responsible for almost 40% of all traffic fatalities nationwide.  Fatalities, you hear?  Where do we get the message?  This is Mayor Rudy Giuliani.  No crap.  The next time you're at a bar or a restaurant or a party and there's any possibility that  you've had too much to drink, don't drive.  Take public transportation, hail a cab, a ball of men.  Public transportation.  Getting behind the wheel is never worth the consequences. 
[56:00]
 Consequences.  A car driven while under the influence is a deadly weapon.  That doesn't get your attention.  Maybe New York City's new policy will.  If you're caught driving drunk, you won't only be arrested.  Your car will also be seized.  Will that inconvenience you?  Absolutely.  But these inconveniences are nothing compared to the tragedy caused by drunk driving.  If you think we're coming down too hard, think about all the families of the DWI victims.  Is our policy tough?  You bet your life it's true.  But we believe it will save lives.  Maybe even yours. 
[56:30]
 Yours.  Maybe even yours.  Suffering sucker cash.  We should take away the rest of his hair.  Yeah, that's a crime.  Because that's more distracting than a guy on the road drunk.  Rudy, your head is a crime scene.  Your offensive big fat head is a crime scene.  We have to confiscate the strip of hair that you have left.  It's suffering sucker cash. 
[57:00]
 Oh brother.  Oh you varmint.  He's a cartoon.  He done took my car.  Hey John, what do you got?  You guys must have doctored that up.  No, I swear.  That's not the mayor of this fair city.  He speaks.  You've got to be kidding me.  Why do you think he's got a complex?  I guess I wasn't paying attention but that's a wicked bad list.  They should have put some music behind it.  Yeah, a little bit.  So it would distract people. 
[57:30]
 I swear to God that is all a him.  Unbelievable.  I'm tough on crime.  I love you guys.  Listen every day.  Hey, thanks.  There he is.  The mayor.  Lispy Giuliani.  Hey, what do you got?  Baby talk baby talk.  It's a wonder you come on.  I'm live.  What?  I want to talk about that ad for Giuliani.  Yeah, go ahead.  You're live on the air.  How's it going man?  Good. 
[58:00]
 Turn down your radio.  That's a delay you're hearing.  Oh, okay.  Alright, what do you got?  Hey, I think I saw Giuliani and Sylvester the cat and Sy's boy having a beer.  That's too much of a lie man.  Sylvester?  Hey.  Alright man.  He's more like Daffy I think.  Daffy Duck?  Yeah, he's got a little tatt.  I know that clip is pretty hard man.  I'll get rid of the rabbit and make it look like an accident.  Thank you guys enough man.  Keep it up.  Hey, thanks buddy.  Take it easy.  Alright.  You dumb duck, try again.  Yeah, you guys, Opie, you said that they should have music in the background, you know, disguised  as Lisp. 
[58:30]
 Yeah.  Well, they figured you'd watch on TV so you'd be like distracted from his head.  You're like, ahhh.  Yes, while we're having a cup of shitting, you're like, ahhh.  You're like, ahhh.  You're like, ahhh.  You're like, ahhh.  You're like, ahhh.  You're like, ahhh.  music with his PSA.  We'll see if that sounds better.  Alright, dude, we gotta go.  Alright, see you later.  I want to see if maybe that touches up his Lisp a little better. 
[59:00]
 Alright, just try.  Because he would need appropriate music.  You couldn't play some kind of fun carnival music because...  Well, I'm thinking maybe...  I'm thinking maybe polka music behind it, too.  No, it's got to be tough because that Lisp...  You know how he's always talking how he's tough on crime, Opie?  Yes.  And everything, and now he's taking away your cars.  Alright.  He's taking away things.  Alright, let's doctor up his PSA.  Let's see if this would have helped a little.  Okay.  The mayor.  Rudy Vader.  So I guess the music would have to start first, right?  Yeah. 
[59:30]
 Okay.  For years you've heard the call not to drink and drive.  But despite the outcry, hundreds of New Yorkers are killed every year by drunk drivers.  It's responsible for almost 40% of all traffic fatalities nationwide.  I like it.  When will we get the message?  This is Mayor Rudy Giuliani.  The next time you're at a bar or a restaurant or a party, and there's any possibility that  you've had too much to drink, don't drive.  Take public transportation, hail a cab, or call a friend.  Getting behind the wheel is never worth the consequences because a car driven while under  the influence is a deadly weapon. 
[60:00]
 If that doesn't get your attention, maybe New York City's new policy will.  Yeah.  Execution.  You won't only be arrested, your car will also be seized.  That inconveniences you?  Absolutely.  These inconveniences are nothing compared to the tragedy caused by drunk drivers.  If you think we're coming down too hard, think about all the things that are warning DWI victims.  Is our policy tough?  You bet your life is tough.  Luke, Luke, the mayor's taking the land, speed up.  Maybe even yours.  Yeah, I like it.  I like it. 
[60:30]
 Rudy Vader.  I'm going to try another one too.  All right.  So that would doctor up the commercial.  See, I didn't notice his lisp as much when you have the Darth Vader music behind it.  Of course.  How about some porno music behind it?  Oh, wow.  Let's try this.  Like Rudy the Wad Juliani?  Sure.  All right, let's try that.  You've got to get some of that good wop wop.  Yeah, let's get some good funk porno music. 
[61:00]
 All right.  Let's see.  All right.  For years, you've heard the whole bunch of drinking drives.  Despite the outcry, hundreds of New Yorkers are killed every year by drunk drivers.  It's responsible for almost 40% of all traffic fatalities nationwide.  When will we get the message?  This is Mayor Rudy Giuliani.  The next time you're at a bar or a restaurant or a bar and you miss any possibility that  you've had too much to drink, don't drive.  Take public transportation, hailing cab or call a friend.  Driving behind the wheel is never worth the consequences because a car driven while under 
[61:30]
 the influence is a deadly weapon.  If that doesn't get your attention, maybe New York City's new policy will.  If you're caught driving drunk, you won't only be arrested, your car will also be seized.  Will that inconvenience you?  Absolutely.  But these inconveniences are nothing compared to the tragedy caused by drunk driving.  If you think we're coming down too hard, think about all the families born in the deep  sea.  Is our policy tough?  You bet your life is tough.  But we believe it will stay alive. 
[62:00]
 Maybe even yours.  Yeah, I like that one.  That's pretty good, right?  They covered up his list.  See, that's what they should have done.  Spice it up a little bit so you don't notice as much.  Get the poker music.  Where's the WWF one?  Yeah, maybe like a powerful thing like if, if, where's Stone Cold Steve Austin's, uh,  music.  Let's try that.  You know how the music he comes into?  Yeah. 
[62:30]
 Is it this one?  Hold on.  Is this his music?  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.  Yeah.  Let's try it.  Maybe Stone Cold Julianne.  The years you've heard the call not to drink and drive.  Yeah.  New Yorkers are killed every year by drunk drivers.  You're not going to take my car, Julianne.  I'll open up a can of whoop ass on you. 
[63:00]
 Mayor Rudy Giuliani.  The next time you're at a bar or restaurant or party, if there's any possibility, too  much to drink, don't drive.  That works.  Take public transportation.  That one works?  Yeah, I like that one.  Okay.  I like the porno one better.  You do?  Yeah.  I think the Darth Vulgar is the best though.  Yeah.  It's more appropriate.  We could try one more here and then we'll move on.  We're just trying to help the mayor out a little bit.  Yes.  He's having a hard time with those S's and L's.  Well, actually we got the Godfather music or polka music. 
[63:30]
 I will do the first 30 seconds of the read with the polka music.  All right.  Try the polka and then Godfather.  All right.  So then we get the polka.  For years you've heard the call not to drink and drive.  But despite the outcry, hundreds of New Yorkers are killed every year by drunk drivers.  It's responsible for almost 40% of all traffic fatalities nationwide.  When will we get the message?  This is Mayor Rudy Giuliano.  Next time you're at a bar or a restaurant or park, if there's any possibility that you've 
[64:00]
 had too much to drink, don't drive.  Take public transportation, hail a cab or ball of fire.  Getting behind the wheel is never worth the consequences because a car driven while under  the influence of a deadly virus.  That doesn't get you out of the car.  I like the polka.  Oh, I think it suits him well.  I like the polka.  Oh my God.  It's a very happy and upbeat.  Such a depressing PSA.  Okay.  It makes me want to drink.  All right. 
[64:30]
 We got to do one more.  One more.  I know the bits getting old.  Trust me.  Trust us.  We know.  We know, but it's too much fun.  Okay.  All right.  The Mayor with the Godfather music behind it.  Let's see how this works.  For years you've heard the call not to drink and drive.  Despite the Alcovado, hundreds of New Yorkers are killed every year by drunk drivers.  It's responsible for almost 40% of all traffic fatalities nationwide.  When will we get the message?  When will you come to a restaurant or party? 
[65:00]
 And if there's any possibility that you've had too much to drink, don't drive.  Take public transportation, hail a cab or call a friend.  Getting behind the wheel is never worth the consequences because a car driven while under  the influence of a deadly virus.  If that doesn't get your attention, maybe New York City's new policy will.  If you're a car driving drunk, you won't only be arrested.  We will whack you.  Your car will also be seized.  Will that inconvenience you?  Absolutely.  But these inconveniences are nothing compared to the tragedy caused by drunk driving. 
[65:30]
 If you think we're coming down too hard, think about all the families mourning DWI.  The families.  The policy tough.  The Tattalias.  The life of Zini.  We believe it will save lives.  Maybe even yours.  All right, Rudy.  That works too.  So I liked the Darth Vader, Godfather and Polka with them.  And the porno.  The porno.  I think all of them are good.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Rudy, Julianne.  Anthony, stacker two.  Stacker two. 
[66:00]
 Stacker two.  I had to take heroin just to come down for stacker two last week.  Well, you want energy, you want quick energy in 45 minutes after you take one of these  stacker two, you're going to be running around like a nut.  And you want to burn fat at the same time.  Stacker two.  Now, they say it burns fat.  I can confirm that.  I can confirm that it gives you a little energy boost.  You look a little thinner, Opie.  I do, huh?  Yes.  Wasting away.  But within 45 minutes, it gives you a nice boost of energy and it burns fat. 
[66:30]
 You can get this stuff in two days because the company is right here in New Jersey.  The guy will run it to you.  Pretty much.  Give them a call if you're interested in this product.  It's stacker two.  Call 1-800-LIGHTLINE.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-LINE.  Call them today.  And they also have a money back guarantee.  So if you're not satisfied with the product, they'll give you a money back.  All right?  Hummer Queen says this is good in the sack.  Really?  Yeah.  That's what she said. 
[67:00]
 I can't confirm that either.  All right.  We're going to take a little music break here.  More talk, less music.  That's what I want to hear.  That's what the listeners want to hear.  According to the feedback we're getting, Anthony.  How about that?  1027 WNEW, the Rycom New York, the Dave Matthews Band.  That's Crush, it's Obey and Anthony.  Hey, man.  I'm just looking at all the stuff we wrote down that we want to talk about today.  And they did another stupid survey. 
[67:30]
 On what?  I hate surveys.  Pregnant smokers often have criminal kids.  What?  See, this is a way you twist a survey around to sound like it's something else.  Anybody with any intelligence can figure this out.  They want to make it sound like, okay, if you smoke while you're pregnant, something  chemically happens through the smoke and your child ends up with this criminal gene, I guess,  and becomes a criminal.  No. 
[68:00]
 People that smoke during pregnancy are probably low lives who are raising criminal kids.  That has nothing to do with the smoke.  They're pretty much more irresponsible if you're smoking as a pregnant woman.  You're probably not going to make a good parent if you don't care about your little child  in the womb.  That's stupid.  I hate surveys like that.  Lampshops on TV, Anthony.  Oh, look at that.  Lampshops on The Nanny?  Yeah, she's a piece of ass.  I'd like to get some of that. 
[68:30]
 Yeah.  A diving head first.  Hey, Lampshop, would you like The Nanny's fist up your butt instead of Sherri Lewis?  Better than that Sherri Lewis.  What a bitch.  I'm glad she's dead.  Lay the legs on The Nanny.  I'd like to put my ears right where I am.  You know what I'm getting at.  Yeah, I know, Lampshop.  Check out her chops.  God, look how bad she is.  What is happening with that stupid show that Lampshop has to guest star on? 
[69:00]
 I don't know.  That's obviously a couple of years back.  Yeah, that's true because she's dead.  Mr. Obvious, thank you.  All right, instant feedback.  Lots of it coming in today.  Dave from New York City writes, love the PSA with Mayor Rudy Giuliani.  Darth Vader music, porno music, Godfather theme.  Yeah, if you want to listen a little while ago, we found a new PSA for drunk driving  that the mayor did. 
[69:30]
 Oh, you're going to be hearing that all over the place.  You're going to probably hear it on every single radio station in New York.  And he's doing a dry read and he's slurring his words and the spit flying from his mouth.  Well, he's got the lisp.  He has two distinct lispies.  Lipses.  One is the spit saliva lisp, which is because of the cheeks and the teeth and tongue jam  that work together.  Then he also has that L thing, almost like a ball clock, but the glinks are totally together 
[70:00]
 and the camel and the saddle work where you think.  You would think they would have put a nice little musical background to hide the lisp.  To hide something.  A lot of times they do that with commercials to hide any imperfections in their voice.  Sure.  So they just had a dry read with the mayor and we noticed, man, he is lisping like Cindy  Brady.  He tried some different music behind the PSA and all of them seemed to work.  My favorite, though, was the Darth Vader music.  That did seem to really go well with Rudy's attitude and everything else because I do 
[70:30]
 think he considers himself quite the Darth Vader type.  And Dave in New York City wrote, you know, he liked the Darth Vader music as well.  I think Giuliani has a cameo in the next Star Wars movie.  Lord Comover.  The Dark Lords of the Force.  I am Lord Comover.  Unfortunately, during an extremely long soliloquy, his helmet's spit valve malfunctions and he  drowns in his own saliva. 
[71:00]
 That's great.  I am Lord Comover, mayor of the Empire.  Please stop that dreadful spinning.  I'll rust for sure.  I am very sympathetic to the Ewok community.  I had to confiscate Han Solo, Millennium Falcon.  He was drunk. 
[71:30]
 Uh-oh, here comes that pain in the ass Landau Calrissian Sharpton.  I just want justice for the rebellion.  I am Lord Comover.  Hey, didn't I get the squeegee guys off of Tatooine?  I removed the five kiddie dancers from the cantina on Alderaan.  Doesn't anybody thank me for that? 
[72:00]
 Yes, I do.  The Comover Death Star will launch saliva and destroy us.  Get me to my list-bling fighter.  Luke, I'm not your father.  I'm your father's sister's second son-in-law.  The guy doing the Darth Vulgar.  The breathing.  As the mayor.  I am Lord Comover. 
[72:30]
 Have him arrested.  I like that, Lord Comover.  Lord Comover.  Look at that many episodes of Lord Comover on the Opiate Anthony show.  Star Wars, A New Hope.  I like that. 
[73:00]
 That's very good, Dave. Thank you.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Pride and Joy from Texas Flood, Zeppelin 2, it's Opiate Anthony.  Well, the faithful listeners love Lord Comover, Andy.  How about that?  I think a brand new character has been born today on the Opiate Anthony show.  Mayor of the Empire.  Boy, if that doesn't suit him, you know?  I like it. Maybe we'll have a new episode tomorrow. 
[73:30]
 That sounds good. If you miss Lord Comover, yes, we'll have some more tomorrow for you.  Yes.  A lot of people also calling and faxing and sending an email about the survey about pregnant smokers often have criminal kids.  A new survey they did we think is completely ridiculous because I think it comes down to if you're smoking nowadays when you're pregnant, you're kind of irresponsible and that could...  Yeah, they switched it around, is what they did. They made it sound like that the smoke has something to do with the kid growing into a criminal. 
[74:00]
 But that's not the case. It's just an irresponsible parent who's smoking probably won't raise the child properly and they will turn criminal when they get older.  Just another stupid survey.  And then a bunch of people started calling and saying, hey, my parents, my mom smoked.  And I'm not a criminal.  When she was pregnant years ago and stuff and my mom smoked too.  When she was pregnant, me with my brother, with my sister, she was popping. We got those old cheesy 8mm movies. 
[74:30]
 Snuff films.  Home movies. Snuff films, yeah. That's what they are, Opie. Snuff films.  Remember bringing the neighbors into the basement and chopping her up.  What are you, an idiot?  Snuff films.  When you say 8mm, 8mm is the format of home movies.  Also the format of the snuff dealers.  Super 8. Yeah. Gives it that good grainy quality when I hack into skulls of the dirty girls. 
[75:00]
 The thing.  We used to have one of the movie cameras and stuff. Took a lot of home movies and a lot of them, when you see my mom pregnant and she's smoking, drinking.  Family used to go out to this bungalow out in Mastic Beach years ago.  And whoever was pregnant didn't matter. They were all, woo hoo!  Having a big luau, drinking my ties and smoking Camel non-filters.  Filled their cigarettes.  And all the kids, you know, came out fine. 
[75:30]
 Well, relatively speaking.  Relatively speaking, I think low birth weight makes for easier vaginal passage.  To tell you the truth, not as many C-sections.  These big fat oven stuffer roasts are butterball babies now.  Because the mothers aren't smoking.  Now they've got to take them out through the gut.  Let me give myself a bell.  Check, please! Check, please!  That's so wrong.  But they didn't know back then, obviously. 
[76:00]
 But we kind of turned out okay.  Right?  I don't think she was smoking in the delivery room.  But that could have happened too. Maybe a little secondhand smoke.  Well, my mom did not smoke, Anthony.  I was going to ask you that.  No, my mom did not smoke.  She didn't smoke during her pregnancy with you?  No, but she was very...  Well, let me ask you a question.  Alright.  How were you born?  What do you mean? The normal way.  What do you mean? Like through the...  Well, but how were you born? 
[76:30]
 Do you think? I'm sure they've talked about it.  Like, was it a real cool delivery?  Maybe they had some soft music playing.  Oh, I don't know. Back then, it was your run-of-the-mill normal delivery.  But there was... I guess, you know, after the pushing and groaning,  I was removed and the doctor kind of wipes you off and cuts the cord  and puts you at the breast of your mother.  And your mom holds you lovingly while you suckle maybe for the first time  and bond with a joyous parent. 
[77:00]
 I guess that's how I was brought into the world.  That's good stuff. Thanks.  So what's the problem?  I was just asking.  So your mom was awake, right?  Yeah, for the most part.  She probably had one of those things that numbed her out or something,  but epidural.  Oh, that's great.  But she nuzzled and very primal.  That's great. Thanks. That's real nice.  I take it there was a difference in the birth of a Hopi? 
[77:30]
 Well, a little different story, sure.  My mom hates pain, so she was really drugged up.  As a matter of fact, I think she was out cold.  So was there any like, push, push?  And no, no, there was no pushing.  I think the doctor took the forceps and...  Oh, no, not the forceps!  No, come on!  And shoved it into my mom's, you know, private area, 
[78:00]
 got a good grasp around my damn little head and yanked me out, Anthony,  with the forceps.  With tongues, with salad tongues.  And then my shocked body was dropped on her lifeless body.  Oh, no. Stop.  You know when you turn on the Discovery Channel  and you see the baby turtles trying to find the ocean?  Oh, it's very sad. Yeah, they're trying their damnedest.  That was me on my mom's belly trying to find her breast.  But they just flopped you on there and...  ...on her lifeless body.  I'm sure she came two hours later. 
[78:30]
 I'm sure she came two hours later.  So you're just like looking for a nourishment source?  Yeah, like the baby turtles do.  That's the only way I can explain it.  That's great.  Your mom was awake.  That is so sad.  So to this day, I like my women passed out.  Yeah, that's why I like them unconscious.  By the way, where can I get some roofies? 
[79:00]
 Oh my God. Wait a minute. Come on.  Is that true?  That's what I'm guessing.  That explains a boatload.  That just sums a lot of stuff right up.  I have some issues.  Some eyes have been dotted,  some T's have been crossed this afternoon.  We had different births.  That's a cute story. 
[79:30]
 What?  Do you think this has affected you anyway in your relationships with women or with your mom now?  No.  I just like my women passed out.  It's kind of about cold.  Yeah, that's always fun.  Whoa.  I should have done something.  What do you think, man?  You've been with me for five years.  Figure it out.  What do we want to do here? 
[80:00]
 Just a beautiful story.  I think we have one more break.  Leonard Skidder, Behind the Music.  The Rock in New York, 1027W, NAW.  Call me the breeze.  Behind the Music with Leonard Skidder, probably the best one they've done thus far.  So depressing.  It's tragic.  What a happy ending, Anthony.  Oh, really?  The band has moved on.  Is it Donnie, Ronnie or Johnny?  Which one died? 
[80:30]
 Ronnie.  Ronnie died.  So Johnny Van Zandt, because Donnie was in 38 Special, right?  Right.  Which one died again?  Ronnie Van Zandt.  So Johnny Van Zandt is now the lead singer, as we all know.  He's been doing great music and filling out arenas.  Yeah, that was a real happy ending, watching the Rossington Collins car wreck thing with the wheelchair.  Oh, just tragedy.  What a cursed band. 
[81:00]
 You've got to admit, though, the best show on TV, Behind the Music.  Oh, yeah.  Now they're just weeding out people that you never knew had problems.  Well, I mention that because Johnny writes in his fax,  I saw over the weekend the VH1 Special on Motley Crue and I laughed my ass off.  Well, we talked about this on the show a month or two ago to hear Tommy Lee talk about when they toured with Ozzy and how effed up they were that they started to mainline Jack Daniels and then Ozzy snorted a whole line of ants.  Yes, ants, live ants made me crack up.  The whole thing where Ozzy talks about it.  Well, we used to go in and see who could do the worst thing.  I saw a bunch of ants walking out of a popsicle stand and they were like, oh, my God, I'm going to die.  I'm going to die. 
[81:30]
 I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.  I saw a bunch of ants walking out of a popsicle stick.  So I just went down there and they were all in line and I snorted them up.  It's like, oh, my God, this guy is gone.  And then the boys mainlining the Jack Daniels, that's just sick.  You didn't have any dope to shoot up so they would shoot Jack Daniels.  Right.  Yeah, well, whatever's fun. 
[82:00]
 And everybody has to have been found at some point with a needle in their arm on the floor, passed out.  And it was found, you know, the manager, he was passed out with a needle in his arm.  Like everybody now in that behind the music has that happened.  It's a theme, okay?  You start with a great career, everything's going fine.  Then you have the disaster.  Then you have the comeback.  And even Rick Springfield.  I saw a little of that one over the weekend.  And Rick Springfield had a big quad accident in the middle of the desert. 
[82:30]
 Who knew?  Did you ever know that?  Broke like six ribs, a collarbone or something.  They didn't think he would be able to perform again.  What a disaster that would be.  Actually, we're still waiting for his comeback.  Where's the comeback face?  Your formula hasn't worked on that.  Rick Springfield.  And quickly, John from Brooklyn writes on the feedback, did you guys catch the show on HBO about Schlaggs?  Has that been on yet?  Is it on tonight?  Might be on tonight. 
[83:00]
 It's called...  Oh, Private Dicks.  Yeah, Private Dicks.  Well, it's the story of the penis.  They go to a bunch of men.  This is the same guy that did the show on breasts a while back.  And women talked about their breasts, various size and ages.  Well, now they get guys from like 17 to 79 talking about their penises.
