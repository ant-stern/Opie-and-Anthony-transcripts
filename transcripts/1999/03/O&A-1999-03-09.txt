 Let it bleed.  Let it bleed.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W The Rock of New York 2 for Tuesday with Leonard Skinner.  The Stones before that with a tasty little track.  Live With Me from Let It Bleed and Respectable, starting off the OP and Anthony show today.  Oh, oh, oh.  What?  I almost forgot, I'm sorry.  Ah, are you sick?  Wow.  Done.  Sorry.  Ralph forgot he always sprays.  I'm done.  I'm now going to be sick from now on.  Sprays the mic with Lysol.  Done.  He's getting me back, oh never mind.  You sneezed on Anthony's mic? Are you serious? How did you sneeze? Ew, is that snot? There 
[00:30]
 is a piece of snot on the top! No, I'm lying. See, you guys exaggerate everything. Oh, we  exaggerate everything? Did you see the pubic hair on the board that we pointed out yesterday?  I know there was bloody tissues. Did you see the bloody tissues yesterday? Was that yours?  No. Alright. Oh well. What a way to start another  show. Wait, hold on. Let me turn your mic on. What happened? Do you really want to know 
[01:00]
 who I think the bloody tissue belonged to? Well, Anthony lost it yesterday because his  work area over there had bloody tissues. You don't know this because you're here late in  the afternoon. But in the morning when I come in, if he's still here, Steve Mason is working  in that area with his laptop, just like you have your setup. Well, not just like it. I'm  not pointing any fingers. I really don't know the proof whatsoever. I don't leave bloody  tissues. There was bloody tissues and blood all over the newspaper. Blood on one of the  And it wasn't the first time it happened. If it only happened once, I'd be like, ah,  somebody was hemorrhaging. It's okay. Well, Devo is bleeding a lot lately. From where? 
[01:30]
 Between his eye and his finger. He cut his finger on the air a couple days ago. I didn't  have my medical bag with me. We have the easiest job in the world. How do you cut your finger  on the job here? How do you cut your finger? Oh, paper cuts. Sorry about that. Oh, you  got me. I forgot about that. Paper cuts. Look at Ralph. Shut me up. Try working with sheet  metal. All right. Are we off and running? Yeah, we're off and running. This is what  we do. It's our show. And they're off. Got to say hi to Brian in Brooklyn sending an 
[02:00]
 instant feedback. There are lots of New York's bravest. Listening to you guys, all the guys  in my house, Engine 156. What's up, boys? They love Yoshi especially, so that's cool.  And are we doing the DiMaggio record today? Yeah, we could do that. Two consecutive days  being dead? Well, the joke goes, what happens on April 23rd, Anthony? They're redoing my  joke. What happens on April 23rd? What, Alpe? Joe DiMaggio will be dead for 56 consecutive 
[02:30]
 days. I don't think I'll ever surpass Lou Gehrig's record. That's a tough one to beat.  As dead Yankee greats consecutively being dead for so many days. But Joe Di working  on it, day two. Did anyone else find the actual paper today? Yeah. There were a couple of  false starts as I'm reading the post and Newsday today. Our 20 page spectacular Joe Di commemorative 
[03:00]
 section. It's like I'm going through the paper going, look, it's all Joe Di news. And then  finally the middle of the paper there's like three, you know, they have the hidden paper  within the paper. Yeah. And it's like, oh, okay, here's Monica on the cover and the daily  news. I mean, jumper almost killed me. Yeah. Is there a better story that is happening  in New York than that one? We had a guy that saw this happen yesterday and he described  what happened to this girl. Well, I got him cued up. Oh, you do? Because we had one of 
[03:30]
 the first eyewitness reports of the incident. Guy jumped off a roof and splat 21 stories.  We were discussing this on the way in. You think he did a header from the description  of his head popping like a light bulb. I would think he had his head hit first. Yeah. Or  else, you know, your fall would be broken enough. I think maybe if she hit with legs  first. So poor Diane, she's on the cover of the daily news. She says she, what did she  say she heard? She heard the wind. Yeah. She heard like a whee and people screaming, but 
[04:00]
 she didn't see because I guess people saw him falling. Was it like a bugs bunny car?  Yeah. When they have this shh. And I guess he didn't crawl out of the hole, dust himself  off and you know, go to acne for some missiles. Yeah. You know, he just splattered all over  every piece of real estate within a 25 foot radius. Can you imagine the guy's arm hit  her? Yeah, that's what happened. They're saying she heard this whistling, heard people screaming. 
[04:30]
 What? What? And the arm, his arm hit her shoulder and she said it felt like a ton. And she fell  down to the ground. Yeah. She, as she gets up a little dazed and opens her eyes, she's  covered with what's left. Yeah. With what's left of this guy all over her and all over  everything. Disgusting, huh? And she's saying that if she was a little over, yeah, a little  bit to the left, she would have been dead. This son of a bitch, you know something? I 
[05:00]
 understand he's despondent. He's out of sorts enough that he wants to jump off a building.  He was a sane enough to call a friend and say he was doing this. You know, take some  pills. There he goes. Oh, that had to hurt. He's out the window. He's despondent. I understand.  But you take pills and lay in your bed and die. Don't threaten other people's lives. 
[05:30]
 She could have killed this poor, he could have killed this poor girl. Let me take the  other side of this though. What? If you're going to kill yourself, you're not thinking  in those terms. He's thought enough to call someone, I'm going to kill myself. Look at  me. I'm, I crap my pants. I ride a little rascal and I got the polyester pants up to  my nipples. I wear the wrap around tongue-ladget and the walker with the wheels and the handbrake.  I'm jumping. But just think, other people aren't old and decrepit and might want to 
[06:00]
 live out their lives. And he just jumps. I think he just, he has the I'm the only person  in the world syndrome. Which we talk about a lot on this show. Yeah, most important person  in the world. And he jumps and almost hits this poor girl who now I think is probably  traumatized. I want to talk to her and ask her how she slept last night. Well, we're  trying to get her on the phone. Hopefully we'll be able to make that happen, Anthony.  I mean, not, could you imagine the type of nightmares? No. I just dream that this guy  with a popped head is chasing you and his arm is constantly hitting your shoulder. Why 
[06:30]
 didn't you catch me? Why? It's your fault. You know, that would be horrific. Hi, NAW.  Hey guys. Hey, what's up? You think that girl, if she got some brain matter on her, she could  say he gave her some head? A wacky little joke there. Yeah, they got to lighten up this  deep. All right, man. Thank you. Thanks, guys. Good job. Well, let's play the eyewitness 
[07:00]
 from yesterday that called in. All right. Pretty sick. All right, Chris. So what happened?  I'm walking down the street in front of the Harley Davidson Cafe and I hear this woman  scream behind me. I turn around and this guy came down and splattered all over the sidewalk.  Like the guy was saying before, he's bringing it all over the sidewalk, all over the side  of this grocery store, this gourmet grocery store. And I don't know about any guy being  hit, but there was a woman there, a young girl in her 20s, absolutely hysterical because  it happened right in front of her. Wow. In typical New York City fashion, the place that 
[07:30]
 body with no cover on it for about 20 minutes. Really? Until someone finally gets a sheet  and covers it. And then there's like a leg sticking out of the back of it. It looks like  one of those cartoon characters with the legs all twisted. And you got some brain on you?  I hate to say I know. I think someone's going to mislead you. I didn't get any brain on  me. Okay. But it was all over the sidewalk and people were walking through it because  they didn't realize what happened right off the bat. Right, you're just walking and all 
[08:00]
 of a sudden it's like, Hey, what is this? Yeah. And then throughout the day, my mechanic  kept sending me back for coffee, which is right around the corner. I kept going back  and checking out every good five, six hours until they finally took it away in a fire  department, just sitting there with their hoses, hosing down the sidewalk with all the  brains going down into the sewer. That's what it all comes down to, doesn't it? Your brains  in the gutter. Yeah, unfortunately it seems so. I hate to run guys, but I got to get to  the bus and get home. All right, buddy. Well, thank you. All right. Later. Bye. And there 
[08:30]
 you have it, Chris, from yesterday. So that's it. He lives 70 some odd years to have his  brains hosed out of the gutter, hosed off the sidewalk. Yeah. We got her for the rats  and that wonderful. All right. Well, um, lots more to do today. We got Johnny line coming  in at four, four o'clock. Yes, we do. Can't wait to see him again. He came by in the summertime.  We had so much fun hanging out with him and I think we're going to play bra bingo with  Johnny line today. Yeah, that's a fun game. We like bra bingo. I haven't played in a while. 
[09:00]
 A lot of people love when we play bra bingo. So you want to tell the people how to, how  to get their cards ready for the game? Anthony? Yeah. If you want to play along at home, you  want to make a standard bingo card, which is a five by five squares with the middle  square of the card being your free boob space. And you throw in random. Let me repeat random  brazier sizes. Yeah. Don't put all the obvious sizes in a row. Yeah. If you put all the  fun, cool, common sizes all in a row, you're going to win very quickly because we just 
[09:30]
 randomly take phone calls and it's, it's, you're only cheating yourself people. Yeah.  You're only cheating yourself. So, uh, we, we suggest putting a bunch of sizes in a hat  and you draw them out and fill them in across that way. So there's no favoritism. The center  square of the free boob square. Free boob. We then take calls from girls who give us  their bra sizes. And if you match on your card, the bra size on the phone, you exit  off and of course, first person that gets five in a row, diagonally or up down across  wins. There you go. Bra bingo. All right. We'll play that sometime after four o'clock 
[10:00]
 with Johnny Lang. And if you do want to play along at home, make your cards up, fill it  in and then you're going to have to fax them to us with your name on it. Sure. So that  way after the game's done, if you in fact did win, you could then fax it to us and we  can check to make sure you didn't just make it up. Right. Yeah. Okay. And maybe we'll  have some tickets or something. You never know. You never know. Oh, one oh two seven  W any W the rock of New York Tuesday with Nirvana from unplugged. That's dumb and come 
[10:30]
 as you are from nevermind. It's Opie and Anthony. Hello. But I think quickly, um, I'm seeing  in USA today, it says shock, jock after shocks advertisers clean up. They say that, uh, advertisers  on radio programs that feature shock jocks do much better than on shows that don't have  shock jocks. Is this today's USA today? Yeah. They talk about, uh, let's say the Greek man.  Yeah. And, uh, Don I must, you know, and, uh, Howard. Yeah. Yeah. And they're saying 
[11:00]
 that, uh, these shock jocks, uh, advertisers, um, don't, don't shy away because they they've  seen through their little research that, uh, people are listening to those ads. They  get people to buy the product. How about that? But I guess, uh, shock jocks is it's a hot  topic in America these days. The Greece man, the Greece man, they're getting fired a couple  weeks back. You're a little down. Do I just can't say anything racially. No, Opie and 
[11:30]
 Anthony get in trouble. Yeah. Yeah. The duty, the, are you still on your apology tour? Grease  man. Apology tour. Yeah. I'm apologizing to everybody. Yeah. The chinks. Yeah. Did  I say chink? Who? Yeah, she did. I'm in trouble again. Yeah. You're shocking. Yeah. You don't  know. Yeah. That's what happened that day. I drank a few too many bone dries and I was 
[12:00]
 drunk on the air. You didn't know what you were saying, right? I knew not what I've,  as I said, so now I'm going around the country apologizing. Well, do you have another? To  anyone that'll listen, I'm doing a radio show in an igloo. Apologizing to the Eskimos. I  said, Hey, you blubber eating dope. Do you have another gig lined up yet? Not yet. Job  offer's not coming in for the Grease Man show. No. What are you going to do if you're out  of radio? I don't know. Maybe television. Look at my good looks. Oh yeah. You look great. 
[12:30]
 Yes. On Nightline. I'm going to do my apology tour though for the next year. I'm just going  to go around everywhere in the world. I don't care who it is. Have you talked to Cosby yet?  The Crouch. The Chink. The Mix. The Dago. Everybody. Yaddle-doodle-dee. I'll apologize to people  I haven't insulted. All right. The Martians. How about those red bastards? The Martians.  Yaddle-doodle-dee. Those short little people. Martians. I hate the Martians. Did I mention 
[13:00]
 homos? Yaddle-doodle-dee. How about the homos? I'll tell a gerbil joke and then apologize  for a year to the homos. Yaddle-doodle-dee-dee-dee. On the Grease Man show's apology tour. Very  nice. Is Anthony still there? Oh hi, Opie. Why do you let him take over the mic like 
[13:30]
 that? I don't know. He just goes. So it's a big article on Shock Jocks in USA Today.  They mention the Grease Man. Yeah, but they're saying the advertisers stay with it. Do they  have other examples of people getting fired for saying something shocking on their radio  show? Let's look. Yes, yes. In Austin, Texas, a radio host joked about assassinating President  and Mrs. Clinton and Vice President Gore. Wow. A Nashville disc jockey called Boxer  Mike Tyson the N-word. He got fired for that? Yeah. And in Sacramento, California, a DJ 
[14:00]
 encouraged motorists to run down illegal immigrants crossing the Mexican border. Yadda-dadda,  why didn't I think of that one? Hop in your cars, run down the wetbacks. Yeah. Yadda-doodle-dadda-day.  Are you kidding? He got fired for that? Yeah. Are we mentioning this article because ours  was pretty intense too. Opie, once again, we were looked over. Our dead mayor in Boston  didn't even rate. It doesn't even rate. Come on, that's better than calling Mike Tyson 
[14:30]
 the N-word. I know. But I've got to say it's not as good as encouraging motorists to run  down illegal immigrants crossing the border. That's up there. Yadda-dadda. I love it.  1027W&W, the Rock of New York. It's Priceline Anthony. Priceline, yadda-dadda-day. Oh, it's  the Greaseman. The Greaseman loves Priceline.com. Are you getting paid to do this live read 
[15:00]
 for us, Greaseman? No, I'm not getting paid. All right. No, not for this. I just love Priceline.  On my apology tour, I'm going to a lot of hotels in a lot of different cities. And I  call Priceline. And you need to save money because you don't have a gig right now. That's  right. I name my own price and yadda-doodle. Priceline comes through and saves the Greaseman  all kinds of money. Plus, if you use their service, they throw in that free hotel room.  I could always use free nights when I'm sitting in my hotel room drinking bone dries, thinking 
[15:30]
 of how can I goof? Goof on the wetbacks, thinking of my next act. Maybe a little joke about  the chinks. I need a free night in a hotel. Yadda-doodle. Well, how did you do it? You  gave him a call at 1-800-Priceline or did you go on the web? I went on the web. My phone's  tapped. Oh, yeah? People hate the Greaseman. I see that. Yadda-dadda. So you went to www.Priceline.com? 
[16:00]
 Yes. All right. And I named my own price for a hotel. And they said, yeah, we'll give you  that price, yeah. And lo and behold, I'm in a hotel for the price I named with Priceline,  yeah. Were you slinging lead in the hotel room? I had my peace. I was packing heat ready  to sling lead with anyone threatening the Greaseman. Woodle-doodle-deedle-die. Snarlingze, Snarlingze,  Snarlingze, bon drai. What do snarlings mean anyway? I don't know. I'm having flashbacks, 
[16:30]
 yeah. It just sounds good on the radio when you say it. I sound like Mr. McGoo, don't  I? Yes, a little bit. Yadda-deedle-doo. Bye, George. Didn't McGoo have that little chink  that I went around with him? Yes, he did. He used to say, Mr. McGoo, Mr. McGoo, yeah,  why didn't they get in trouble there? How come McGoo never had to apologize like the  Greaseman does for making fun of the little chink who said, Mr. McGoo, Mr. McGoo, what's 
[17:00]
 that? Well, it's Priceline.com. Oh, that's right. We're doing a commercial. Priceline.com.  All right, we're going to be talking to Johnny Lang in just a bit here. Stick around for  that. And then later on on the show, Sammy Hagar coming in for a visit. I think we're  going to be drinking tequila with Sammy Hagar, right? Yeah. He sent over the bottle and we  might as well try this stuff today. Let's drive it. 1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York,  two for Tuesday with Rush. Closer to the heart in subdivisions, it's Opie, it's Anthony, 
[17:30]
 and it's our pal Johnny Lang, everyone. How do you? Johnny's back, man. When were you  here last? Do you remember? A year ago or something, man. Was it that long? We haven't  even been here a year. We haven't been here a year. Believe me, it seems like 10 years.  We've aged about that 10 years. You want to put your headphones on or not? Oh, I'm fine.  I can hear you guys. Oh, really? You won't be able to hear the callers. Oh, play the  Hammerstein ballroom tomorrow night. Yep. All right. And here he is back and you're  going to be playing in the imaginary ballroom in a little while. So Anthony has a question 
[18:00]
 about the Nickelodeon thing. How old was that? How long ago was that? I don't recall doing  that, but somebody. You don't? No, somebody told me today. Was it cute? Oh, it was just  adorable. Yeah, no, I'm laying in bed and it's Saturday morning or something. It was  that Linda Elibi show, that Who, What, Where, Nick News thing. And it's some kind of new  thing. You could tell they take clips from all over. They're not Nickelodeon's little  wacky bubble camera. They're not shooting things. Obviously it was taken from something 
[18:30]
 else, little video clips and stuff. Right. I was like, hey, look, it's Johnny Lang. Look,  he's 10. It was pretty funny. I think I remembered doing it a little bit. Really? Yeah, it was  good. It was a very sweet, cute little piece. It had your long hair then. Yeah. Oh, it's  growing in a little bit. I thought about my obsession with unicorns. I remember that.  It's growing in though, your hair. I see that. Yeah. You're going with the gel thing? No, 
[19:00]
 it's Dax. What is that? That's every kind of oil you can fit in a little jar. Dax? I  thought it was something to do with there's something about Mary. Dax. Well, then I'd  never have to put anything in my hair ever again. What was I going to say? I lost my  train of thought. Dax? Yeah. It says you're only supposed to put it in your hair like  once every three weeks. Really? For better healthy hair, I use it every day. No, no, 
[19:30]
 no, it kind of looks good. Yeah. So we've been jamming the new CD, Wander This World.  Cool. I love it. Great, man. Want to tell the people about it that haven't picked it  up yet? Yeah. It's a little different. Yeah. It's a little segue from the blues thing.  It's kind of like more of a funky soul, R&B rock kind of album. I hear this. I put it  in a genre. It fits in that very. We hear the R&B. Definitely. Cool. And how's the touring 
[20:00]
 going? It's great. Have you been touring ever since you saw us last? Yeah. Seriously?  Oh, yeah. Is it getting old? No. Really? No, man. You look at BB King and you're like,  no excuse to have a second tour. Yeah, but I mean, come on, look at back then and stuff.  Why? But I mean, you put like 260 shows a year. Still? Yeah. Please, God, the white  man took all his money. Well, isn't that the truth? Well, come on now. I think that's 
[20:30]
 the truth, right? Didn't that happen? Like BB. Well, he didn't get the greatest record  deals when he was first starting out. I don't think anybody did, but I watched this show  last night, this rock show, and they showed a bunch of black artists back in the fifties.  And obviously white radio wasn't playing the black artists. So they had white guys doing  the black guys songs. But I mean, they had Pat Boone doing a wumpa bolluba. It was like,  hey, a wumpa bolluba, a ballub, it just didn't work. So BB, I guess, got caught up in that 
[21:00]
 whole thing too where white guys are doing his own. He wasn't getting money and credit  for it. And now he's making up for lost time. Apparently. But you though, I mean, come on,  you could take some time off, right? Well, hang out? Yeah. Do you get home and stuff  or you're just like constantly torrent? No, I get home, you know, once a year. Really?  No, it's, I probably at home, you know, two, three months out of the year. And then what? 
[21:30]
 Like your friends come up, Hey, look, he's like the cool guy. Do you have any friends  or is it just a drag? No, I have no friends. It's great. Really? I can't tell if you're  serious or not. No, no, it's no, man. I got, you know, my buddies from second grade. Really?  They didn't turn into dicks or anything? No, no, no, it's great. So like, Hey, man,  Hey, no, it's cool. Johnny will buy the beers, man. You know, cause what are they doing?  Working like seven 11 or something? Oh yeah. Well, Pepsi, uh, the, my friend Brett works 
[22:00]
 at the Pepsi plant in Fargo. Really? Yeah. So, Whoa. That's a huge, that's a gig. You're  the man. If you got my job, right? Yep. Wow. I was going to leave Fargo if things didn't  get better. Then I got the job at the Pepsi plant. Yeah. What else? Any other, uh, you  know what? So I gotta be the guy that works at the convenience store that just thinks  when you come back home, it's like, wow, look, it's Johnny line. No, there's the guy that  still lives with his parents. Yeah. No job. And wait, wait, wait, but most people your 
[22:30]
 age still live with their parents. Right. Right. No. Well, we got guys in their thirties  that still live with their parents down here in New York. He's how old are you guys now?  18, 19. I'm 18. Yeah. Yeah. Same. 18. When was your birthday? January 29th. Really? So  recently, what'd you do? Must have a big 18th bash. I, uh, no, no, I was touring. I got  a tap too and, uh, spent some time with my girlfriend who has the same birthday. Let 
[23:00]
 me see the tat. There it is on the show. Wow. Look at that. That's some kind of Mayan artwork.  Yeah. It's the Aztec calendar. Just in case you forget what day it is. Exactly. Look at  my shoulder. In Aztec, it's nice. Now you're 18. You're on the road like nine months out  of the year, 10 months out of the year. Why a girlfriend? Why? I'm serious. Stability,  Opie. If I was a rock star at 18, that would be the furthest from mine. Yeah, but look,  he's been doing this for years now already. He's probably so sick of it. Yeah. No, you 
[23:30]
 know, it's, I don't know. She's like my best friend. Look at us discussing your life. See,  Opie, what it is in his life. No. Any, any book or anything going to come out about how  bitter you are about having to tour so much? Definitely. Really? I can see that. Like,  you know, I was a kid and they had me rushing around. No, you're not going to come out with  one of those things going, they never allowed me to put the chart on the record label, held  me down and made me cut my hair. That's why I was in the car with a transvestite. I was 
[24:00]
 never able to be a child. I started preaching from the Bible, Samson and Delilah. I must  cut your hair. I have to. To do it with a hatchet. No, no bitterness or anything? No.  You're a happy guy? Yeah. That's good. You come across that way. Well, good. We like  that because we're miserable. Anybody happy in this room, we're happy about it. We're  getting happier though, I guess. All right. So wait. Shut up. All right. What's the, you  guys got like the beach scene? Oh, tequila? Well, we got Sammy Hagar coming in a little 
[24:30]
 later too. Oh, really? Yeah. And he's got this tequila or something from his place in  Cabo. All right. So he goes on other radio shows but they're not allowed to drink on  the radio because it's some kind of like FCC law. But we're going to crack that puppy open  and do some shots. Oh, yeah. You're 18. Oh, God, what's the drink in Asia? Yeah. Well,  Canada. Yeah. He's legal in somewhere. 21 it is. I remember it was 18 when I turned  18 in New York. It was just like, you had a drink, right? You got the tat. You usually 
[25:00]
 don't get tats unless you're drunk. No, no, I've never. Your girl got a tat also? No,  she didn't. Oh, I thought she was going to. Yeah. She either chickened out or just pleaded,  I'm not ready or something. Yeah. That is a big commitment. Hey, who's this? Maria.  Hi, Maria. You got a question for Johnny? No, actually I just wanted to let him know  that we saw him in Philly on Sunday and he was so excellent and it's so amazing that  he's so young and so talented. Yes. So supple and firm. What? Is he? He is. So you're kind 
[25:30]
 of bummed that he has a girlfriend? No, I share. Wow. Where are you from? New York.  Oh, I won't be there for a while. Oh, that's great. I saw you already anyway, but you're  really good and keep it up. All right. You going tomorrow night, Hammerstein? No. No?  Well, you never know now. You never know. Hopefully my boyfriend's listening and he's 
[26:00]
 going to take me. All right. Well, thanks for calling in. Bye. So in a fight, do you  think you could like kick all three Hanson guys asses? No. Like what? Not Frank and Hanson,  I don't think. I think if you took Frank and Hanson out of the mix, the older one. I couldn't  even take the little one, man. They're really cool guys. Did you meet them? Yeah. I figured  that would have to be something they would hook up. Some stupid publicist thing. Wait,  where's the publicist? Like, we got to get them together with Hanson. Get the girls on  board. You got a good Hanson story? Well, yeah. We're all drinking backstage, banging 
[26:30]
 broads. But all of a sudden, Frank and Hanson. How bad is that? That poor older brother?  I mean, you got the two little cutesy kids, right? And the chicks are just totally after  him. After the shows, they do the meet and greet and all the little girls come up and  poor Frank and Hanson's got to stand there like, and you know, the kids' moms are coming  up going, you're just a lovely boy. And meanwhile, you know, the other two Hansons are just getting 
[27:00]
 16 year old broads. Oh, you're a ruthless. But you're getting that, though, right? Let  Johnny tell us Hanson's story. What happened with you and Hanson? Well, they just, they  live in Tulsa, Oklahoma. And they came to our show and hung out. They were just, they're  so cool. They're like, so level headed. Really? I see. I think that's going to come out in  a book, though. You can't be that young and have that kind of success. You know, what's 
[27:30]
 the little one was like in the fetus? I think that originally the mother was in the gynecological  startups and drumsticks were coming out of her womb playing the drums. That was the first  Hanson recording. Really? Yeah. No, I don't think it could be that young and have that  kind of success and stuff without being bitter and writing the book at, you know, 22. Well,  and you have to have all 10 fingers. Yeah, that's, you know, you can't play before you  There's a behind the music special waiting to happen with Hanson, you know, look at, look 
[28:00]
 at that other one with what's his name there? Um, um, uh, Lace Garrett. Did you see that  one? Oh man. Did you see that? Yeah. My dad told me about it. He said it was pretty. Oh,  you got to say, I think, I think you being a young guy who's, uh, you know, popular and  stuff, you ought to watch that and you take notes because, uh, you don't want to go that  route. Don't let any of these idiots tell you what to do, including us. Hi, NW. Hi.  Hi, who's this? Hi, Sherry. Hi, Sherry. What do you got for Johnny? Oh, I had a question  for him. I actually emailed it to you guys, but, um, I guess you're not looking at your  screen or your monitor or whatever. I had a question that he was on a TV interview and 
[28:30]
 they were asking him why he failed his driving test and he didn't answer. He said his grandma  was watching. I didn't know if he could answer that now. Well, grandma's not listening. So  Johnny, you got to fess up. Um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,  look, he's, he's flustered. The Hansen brothers were there. No, I, I, well, I didn't study the  book. So I, you know, they let me by with a written on the third time. Wait, the written you 
[29:00]
 fail? Oh yeah. Try it. Try it in LA, man. What does a stop sign mean? What did you guys  do? I mean, come on. No, the guy could play guitar behind his back with his eyes closed.  That driving thing. I don't know. Yield. What does that word even mean? You guys like took your  driving test in the thirties. So how does a horse and buggy make it across in four way? 
[29:30]
 Thank God. That's, that's the old any double. Good. He did make us look old though. So yeah,  I remember taking mine, the radio on Bob, a Bob, a bang, a dang, dang.  Hi, any W. Hi, you got a question for Johnny? It's all ladies calling him for you. Of course.  Get ahead. What's your name? How do you know I'm an old lady? I said all ladies,  all ladies, not old lady. Okay. I was beginning to feel insulted. Well, how old are you? 
[30:00]
 We'll work on that. Excuse me. That means you're old. Yeah, I'm old enough to be his mother  and I'm a big fan and I want to mother him. No, I don't. I have my own children. Thank you very  much. I'm just very, I feel sorry that your mother didn't take you driving so that you could have  passed your test. Well, I did eventually pass it. So now I thought you had a drive. Well, I grew up  on a farm. That doesn't tell me anything. I grew up on a farm myself. So then you know what I'm  talking about. I didn't see cars there. You didn't? Well, you drove the combine, didn't you? 
[30:30]
 No, no, we had the carriages pulled by the oxen. Oh, okay. That's how old I am. Come on. Well,  we had motor vehicles on my farm. So. No, see, we didn't have any. My father couldn't afford them.  All right. Do you have a question for Johnny? Yes, I do. I wanted to know if his music has  been influenced by Stevie Ray Vaughan. Oh, definitely. Of course. I think his influence to me  was more just his energy as an artist instead of, you know, trying to copy his guitar licks. You 
[31:00]
 know, he was just so intense and that really rubbed off on me, I think. Oh, yeah. Because  I do. The reason why I appreciate your music is because you play with as much intensity as he does.  Oh, thank you. Well, that's the drugs, ain't you? No, it's not. He looks like a pretty clean kid.  But I think you play from your heart and that's why you're so successful. Right on. Well, thanks  for calling. Take care. Thank you. Bye bye. No drugs or no drug problem, right? No. Good. Good. 
[31:30]
 No pot. Well, you know what it is. You grow up and you grow up in the public eye like this  and a lot of people who went through that whole age bracket at least experimented with we,  you ever take a poke or anything? Well, I mean, the scars are clearing up. I see that the track  marks. No, that's good. That's good. You got it. You got to stop that. You got to get the monkey  off your back. Yeah, definitely. The H, the big H, the horse, the smack. Hey, Spike. Yeah, what's  up? You got something for Johnny? Yeah, I got a question. All right. We've seen Spike naked. 
[32:00]
 She's really hot. Oh, it's Spike. Yeah. Yeah. You're raw. Well, I saw him about nine times  opening up for Aerosmith a couple of summers ago and I was blown away. Of course. He's great. I mean,  16 years old, just playing like you couldn't even imagine. I was amazed. She's a dominatrix,  too, by the way. Yeah. Wow. I know she's got a tattoo. Johnny? You do? It says  pink. Right. It says what? Pink, right? Yeah. Right on the, because of Aerosmith with an arrow. 
[32:30]
 With a pubis mom. That would be that Aerosmith pink. Yeah. Oh, she has Aerosmith pink. What can  I say? She has the best tattoo I've ever seen in my life. It's a good one. It's like a road map.  In the best place, maybe. Okay. Actually, I noticed a lot of mannerisms that possibly were  picked up from Steven. Just wondering if you had any influence from there?  Oh, you know, I think every band, you know, we've been out with touring or whatever,  getting to see them live, it's kind of like learning through osmosis. You know, 
[33:00]
 you pick up stuff, you don't really, you know, know you're picking up. And so  you don't even realize it until you see yourself doing it. Right. But no, I think,  you know, Steven and I went to the same mannerism school.  I can explain a couple things. All right, Spike. Very cute. Thank you. Very excellent. Take care.  All right, Spike. We love Spike. Checking in. Yes. All right, let's take a break so we can get  you playing in the imaginary ballroom. All right. Sorry about that. 1027W and EW, the rock of New 
[33:30]
 York. It's Sophie and Anthony and our pal Johnny Lang. We love when he steps on by the studio.  Is Wander This World song rocked? Thanks, man. Are tickets still available for tomorrow's show?  Really? Very surprised at that. Hammerstein Ballroom tomorrow night with Johnny Lang will  all be there. Yes, we will. Hanging and partying. You want to play a quick game of Bra Bingo with  us before you get out of here? Since I'm 18 now, yes. You could have played when you were 16.  Something tells me he was. Yeah. Don't let him kid you. He was playing the braille version of 
[34:00]
 the game. You're going to have to prove that. What size is that? Well, we got our bingo cards  in front of us. This is our favorite game on the Opie and Anthony show. It's a five by five bingo  card. The center square is the free boob square and then we filled in random bra sizes. You can  mark off your free boob square right now. All right, I'm going to circle that. You're giving that.  Okay, I'm going to tell, can I tell what order for them to come in? No, that's cheating. 
[34:30]
 Oh man. Hi, who's this? Hi, how are you? Good, how are you? You like Johnny Lang? Oh yeah.  All right. Oh yeah. She gets all giddy. Are you excited to tell them your bra size? Oh,  only 14. You are a sick man. Wait a minute. This is good. I have like a small size on here.  Oh, thanks guys. 24 AAA. I got that. All right, you got a question for Johnny Lang before we get 
[35:00]
 started. Yeah, I just wanted to say that I was at the concert last night and I just want to say  it was totally amazing. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Well, thanks for calling. Okay. Okay.  Thank you very much. All right. Bye. Okay. Bye. It's now so called the VL station. It's in sync  there. Hi, any W. Any W. Hello. Hi, you're not a girl. No, I'm not. I was in a record store last 
[35:30]
 night and I found a CD, Kid Johnny Lang and the Big Bang and Warner and what happened to that band?  Or is that like a transformation of his current band? No, that's my evil parallel twin. No, I,  yeah, I did that when I was like, when I was 13. It was the first album I ever did. And yeah,  that band, we kind of got defunct there. Everybody kind of went their own way.  Oh, no, it's not. So I saw your first time about two years ago. You played in a hard rock cafe. 
[36:00]
 Yeah. And I was there. It was a great window into what was to come. And I think you're really  great. And I'll see you tomorrow night. The Hammond's down. All right. Take care. All right.  Bye bye. We need some Braziers. Yeah. We need Braz. Hi, any W. Hi. Hi. Who's this? Elizabeth.  Elizabeth, how old are you? 13. Oh my God. I'm ruining your game.  Sorry. No, it's okay. All right. You got a question for Johnny? I'm going to tomorrow 
[36:30]
 night's concert. I just want to know if I can get backstage. Yeah. I just want to get an autograph.  Pardon? What would you do for an autograph? Check, check, please. Check, please. Maybe some  bacon cookies. You're the one with the sick mind. You're going to be like, oh, look at him. He's  trying to get that little article in the daily news. What? He's trying. Hey, honestly, if you 
[37:00]
 want to come to a meet and greet or something, ask for, no, I'm not going to say his name.  Well, we can put her on hold. Yeah, we can do that. All right. Hold on the line. Okay.  Okay. All right. Well, this broad bingo is working out. Oh, he almost screwed that up for us. Hi,  any W. Hi. I have a question for Johnny Lang. You sound a little older. How old are you? I'm 23.  All right. Well, I don't want to do the broad bingo thing. Well, let's say you did want a real  question here. I'm a musician. I'm an artist. I'm not going to go there. I just have a question. 
[37:30]
 I'm a fan. All right. I'm just a fan. Let's say you were playing. What size would you say your  bra is? Well, can I talk about my question? Only if you give your bra size first. Oh, no. This is  a game. This is a rule. This is society. All right. I'm going to get y'all excited. I'm Sam.  I'm 34 double D. All right. 31 double D. You have that? No, I don't. But I do.  Do you really play bingo in there? Oh, I have a single D. 
[38:00]
 Of course you do. I think you got the cards. Of course we do. All right. What's your question  for Johnny? All right. Here. First of all, as far as performing venues, I was just curious  what your favorite thing was, whether it was a recording studio or a smaller gig or something  large like the garden. Because I caught you opening for Aerosmith 97 in the summer. And when they  brought you out on stage, I was first row. So I noticed. And you didn't seem quite as aggressive 
[38:30]
 as I expected you to be. You seemed a little shy about getting out there. I thought, you know,  guys, you have a great voice and you're cute. You know, you got it all going on. Where was this? The  garden garden. Well, think about it. You step out of the garden. It's not like stepping out of  the coffee house down in the village. He practically stepped out of the womb singing. He's 18. He's  already like a big blues phenomenon. Everybody's acknowledged him. I mean, it's not like he's like,  this is my first gig. You know, I mean, I think so. Do you want your money back? 
[39:00]
 I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. It's really, it's really, it's so difficult. She had a curse.  She had a curse. She used the F word. We're on a delay so we can dump that out. Yeah. Yeah.  Which we did. Is that amazing technology? If you're still listening though, thank you.  That was very observant of you. I was really nervous. You know, is Aerosmith. 
[39:30]
 Well, you're opening up for Aerosmith. Yeah, of course. So you know what I noticed? You have to  get a little more bitter. You're really nice. I understand that you're fans and everything and  you have to be very nice to them. But somebody like that go, you know something, kiss my ass.  It's Madison Square Garden. If I was a little nervous stepping out on stage, I was nervous.  What are you reading my emotion? Listen to the music, enjoy the show and shut up. Well, hey,  if I got your money, screw you. That's what he means. Right? That is Anthony talking.  That is not Johnny Lang talking. 
[40:00]
 Let's move on here. Hi, Annie W. Hi, I'd like to play Robin. Oh, it's about time. What's your name?  Betty. Hi, Betty. Hi. How old are you, Betty? Oh, you don't want to know. Sure. No, we don't. Go  ahead. I'll be 43 this year. Move right on. Can I ask John something real quick? Yeah, of course  he can. Is he going to join the Hummer Club or what? Oh, the Tuesday Hummer Club. Yeah,  we have a new club, John. Yeah. I don't want to know this. I get a free Humvee. 
[40:30]
 If you can travel 60 miles upstate, then yeah, sure. Well, we encourage the ladies to,  she might even pop her teeth out for you. Wonderful. Thanks, John.  I'm kidding. Come on. We're just joking. We love our fans. I know. We encourage the ladies  to give Hummers on Tuesdays, John. Yeah. It's been working, right? Yes, it has been. All right, 
[41:00]
 what's your bra size? 36C. 36C. Hey, what do you have between your boobs now that you didn't when  you were a kid? Yes. Your belly button. I have my first mark. All right, thank you, Betty.  Hey, what size was that? 36C. Right. Oh, I got that. Thanks, Betty. All right.  Okay. All right. Oh, good. That lines up with my free boobs face. You guys are making me out to be  kind of a sick puppy here. No, no. You're getting into the game. It was a quarter square for you. 
[41:30]
 You're being coerced. Everyone can see it. Hi, how are you? Good. I want to play Bra Bingo.  What's your name? It's Ellen. How old are you? I'm 39.  Oh, okay. What's your bra size? 34C.  I have to have that. I saw that earlier on my card. You have to have it. 34C. Yes. Yes, me too.  That's a ha ha. Ha ha. Did everybody win yet? Oh, that's quarter square for me.  Yeah, I see that. That's my corner too. I hope we don't have the same card. 
[42:00]
 No. Now listen. What do your boobs look like? What do they look like?  Like if you had to describe them in the form of a fruit, let's say.  They're nice peaches, but they're not fuzzy. Peaches? Johnny Lang's holding up the lemons  that we're going to be using for our tequila in about 20 minutes. Oh, good.  Thanks for playing Bra Bingo. Thank you. All right. Come on. Come on. Hi, N.E.W.  Hi. Hi. Who's this? Elizabeth again. Oh, Elizabeth. I'm sorry. How are you? 
[42:30]
 I'm good. I'm still here. All right. What do you got now?  She's holding. Oh, this is the girl that wants to go backstage. Oh, yeah. Hi. All right. Hold on.  Hold on a second. Somebody's got to work these phones. God, she's still waiting. Hi, N.E.W.  All right. No, you're right here. You're on the air. Hey, John. How are you? Good. What's your name?  Hi, Melissa. You want to play Bra Bingo? Yes, I do. 34B. 
[43:00]
 34B. Oh, I got that. It's the other corner. Me too. I got that. All right. You got a question  for Johnny Lang? No. Okay. That's better. Hi, N.E.W. Hi. Hi. Who's this? This is Shashan.  Shashan. Shashan. Yeah, I like that name. Thanks. Where are you calling from?  From Manhattan. Okay. You got a bra size? Yes, I do. All right. Let's hear it. It's 34D.  34D? Yeah, I got that. I'm getting all the corners, but I need a... Oh, that's good. That kind of 
[43:30]
 lines up. All right. Right on. It's Opie. It's Anthony. And Sammy Hagar is... He's in the  building, Anthony. He's upstairs. We're going to get him in a couple minutes and we're going to get  hammered with Sammy Hagar. Because tequila. What is he making for us today? Some of these margarita  things. Oh, right on. All right. Stick around for Sammy Hagar. If you got a question for Sammy,  you could ask that today. I don't wear headphones. It's okay. Cool. The Rock of New York, 1027WN. 
[44:00]
 N.E.W. Two for Tuesday with Van Halen. Finish what you started. And Ice Cream Man before that. Sorry,  Sammy. You've got a bottle walking on that. Yeah, I know. I'm going to drink this whole bottle.  Yeah, we were like, put the monitor down outside. Don't let him hear that one.  Yeah, what are you doing, Andrea? Wait a minute. It's legal. She's the one that did it.  Did she program the music knowing Sammy's going to be in here and you'll play that...  We'll give her three shots in a row. You play that Cubic Zirconia Dave song? 
[44:30]
 Ice Cream Man. You're drinking tequila now, okay? It doesn't go with ice cream. Yeah,  yeah. You brought the tequila. This is a step up for us because last week we were drinking 40s.  Yeah, we were. We had a guy, Old Dirty, come in because there's some problem with one of these  malt liquors advertisements in New York. They were saying it's racist and stuff. So we wanted  to taste test it. So we had a guy come down and we were getting snotted on bad malt liquor. This  stuff though... Why would they say malt liquor is racist? Look, I'm stirring it up here, man. 
[45:00]
 I don't know. It was one of the posters because one of the posters advertising this malt liquor...  Well, Lou Rawls was the first guy to advertise. Remember the boys? Yeah, baby.  Brother endorses it. So they figured it must have worked. They said they target the African  American communities with the advertising. And that's what's racist. It's totally cool.  That's what we were saying. Exactly. And then the next thing you know,  my picture's in the paper next to the Greaseman. Yeah. Yadda dadda dee. Well, 
[45:30]
 you guys should drag me behind the car. Yeah, well, there you go.  You can drag me and we'll set the record straight. I'm sure some people in Van Halen wouldn't mind.  Well, you must be so sick of that. Like any references with Van Halen because everybody  asks you, what happened? What's the whole thing? I'm not about to go back through it now. No,  but the truth of the matter is as truthfully as more time goes by, I have more and more good  memories and less and less bad memories because in all honesty, the first 10 years were fantastic. 
[46:00]
 Right. It was a ball. You know, we got a couple arguments two or three times maybe.  You know, it never came to blows or nothing. Right. But that last year, which didn't come  to blows, but kind of wish it would have, you know, got a lot of it. I probably felt so pissed  for about the first two months, you know, right. But no, you know, it was just a bad, it was like  a great movie with a bad ending. That's all. Yeah. Yeah. I got nothing bad. See, the longer  it goes, like say you forget about all the crap. That's like any relationship. Yeah. I hear an old  song, I finish what you started and I start remembering, you know, recording it and stuff. 
[46:30]
 And then you hear ice cream man and you want to kill somebody. I got to get in your head really  fast. So you leave Van Halen. Okay. Yeah. And you're watching the MTV music awards. Yeah. Exactly.  And you see that mess, David Lee Roth walk in on stage with the rest of the band. What was  it? Yeah. What was that? Like one of those like embarrassing moments. I'm going, Oh my God.  You know what? I was honestly, the first twisted thing that went through my mind was  what if someone thinks that's me? Oh no. Like some guy watching it, you know, 
[47:00]
 the judge doesn't really know who Van Halen is. What did they do to him? That's that Sammy Hager.  Okay. What's his problem? Why is his pants up to his nipples? Why is he making all those funny  gestures? Even like Eddie and the rest of the guys were so like uncomfortable on that stage. Man,  I'll tell you, I was, that's definitely a low point. But you know what? Here we go again. Now  here's, here's a good thing. You know, everybody says, you know, well, were you happy, you know,  when their record didn't do so good without you? I'm saying, of course I was, you know, 
[47:30]
 that's the last thing you want, you know, it's like to leave the band. I did when I joined the band  and it goes on and gets, has more success. I probably, Dave is probably still dying about that.  I would have felt the same way. No doubt about it. That's a horrible thing. But when I saw him on  there, I was worried because I was thinking, man, Dave's coming back in the band, you know,  a lot of the fans are going to like that and they're going to go out and what if they perform  and what if it's like really great? Right. You know, and I was sitting there kind of nervous,  kind of, you know, didn't really want to watch it. Man, well, that's cool. You say that. I just  jumped up off the ground and said, yes, everything's going to be okay. 
[48:00]
 When you break up with any girl or anything like that, you don't want to see her date in a doctor  and stuff. You want to see with the crack head or something, you know, like, oh, what happened,  honey? After me. See him on the street corner. Right. So you were relieved at that point,  right? Yes, sir. And then we'll get the other Van Halen question out of the way. Then the new  album comes out, Van Halen III. And honestly, we were working in Boston at the time. We were embarrassed  to play that on the radio. We really were. And they would beg us to say, no, man, be cool. Gary 
[48:30]
 Serone is from Boston and stuff. And he's a good guy. We like Gary Light. And we interviewed him  when he was in Extreme and stuff. But obviously they were trying to make him sound like you.  I don't think they were trying. When I joined the band, I realized Eddie picks up a guitar.  Sometimes it's not even tuned to anything. And it's just the way, you know, we made records.  You just play a riff. And if I like the riff, I'd start singing to it. I would write some lyrics, 
[49:00]
 come up with the melody. We had a song. Boom, right? You don't even know what key they're in  sometimes. So the point is, is that's the way it goes. Gary's voice, you know, my voice was OK in  those registers, right? Right. But obviously it was a little bit of a strain. And, you know,  because I mean, to me, saying better in Extreme. But I'm not putting Gary down. This thing is fun.  He's totally cool. Everything's fine with Gary. I got no problem. Well, let's sing. I wouldn't  want to step into that situation, especially, you know, it just sounded like a bad parody of 
[49:30]
 what you were doing in the band. That's what scared me because Gary Saron has a great voice.  And it's like singing to the guitar chords and the changes in Eddie's tunings and stuff. You know,  he's a unique guitar player and singing to those kind of changes that he does kind of is very  restricting. You almost have to do certain things and finding a melody to sing sometimes was  difficult. You know, in a song like Finish What You Started, which is mainly my trip,  right? Some of the songs that were a little more melodic were like that was kind of my input. But  some of the jams where I would just yell and scream a couple things and let some music go by 
[50:00]
 and yell and scream again because there wasn't much of a melody you could really put to some of that  type of music. And unfortunately, this was like an Eddie solo record. This is unfortunate for Gary.  And there was just tons of those kinds of songs. Normally I'd weed those out. I'd be saying,  oh no, Eddie, get that out of there. Let's put a different chord change there. No, you can't go to  that chord because it screws up the melody I got going here. And you know, we wrote together. It  was a good thing. But I don't think Gary knew about doing that. And he just tried to make it  work. And it's just not singer friendly. Some of those guitars. Yeah. Yeah. You got to like, 
[50:30]
 it's like your balls. Yeah, there was, it should have been instrumental. Yeah. There was a lot of  stuff going on with the, with the guitar work on that album. It's difficult walking into a band with  what? How many years? You know, 11 with me, eight with Ramos, 20 years of history and throwing a new  voice in there. And when you're not seeing it, you're just hearing it. You're going, Jesus,  sounds like Van Halen, but you know, some things a little amiss. It's like the retarded brother.  Did you remember where you were when you heard the album for the first time? Yeah,  I was at my house in Hawaii and someone sent it to me in the mail. Oh yeah. Way before it came out. 
[51:00]
 I let it sit on the counter, just like the MTV thing. I let it sit there for about three days.  I kept looking. I'm saying, I'm not ruining my vacation. You know, what if it's great?  Right. Right. What if it's great? Put it on. No one said a word in my house, man.  Had it cranked and a couple of people over. They conned me into it. Actually. I said, come on,  let's hear it. Let's hear it. So I had to get brave. A couple of shots of tequila, maybe a big hit of  a dude, you know, and then put it on about four songs into it. I did it. Once again, I jumped up 
[51:30]
 and said, yes.  Oh boy, you guys are dragging me right back through this. You were relieved. Hey, your club.  Yeah. Now I thought that wasn't, that was always yours. Oh, was that all? I built it. I was in  Van Halen at that time and I'd been going down there before then. I had a place down there. I  lived down there part time. I used to go down there and write all my lyrics. And so I started 
[52:00]
 building this club and it was to be a tequila bar, tequila, mezcal bar. It's my whole thing.  I went to the town tequila and I discovered all these great little boutique tequila's that you'll  never see. It's a town of 35,000 people now, man. It's like Napa Valley or it's like, you know,  Bordeaux or something. It's like bumper to bumper and stuff. Used to be donkeys in carts, you know,  but anyway, you know, those shows you've heard of. So I built this club and our manager at that time,  Ed Leffler, who passed away in 93, he says, or 94, he said, you know, I think I said, 
[52:30]
 Ed, hey, I want to make this a big grand open. I want to fly all these other bands and musicians  down and jam, you know, with us. And he goes, well, you, if you're going to get the guys and  the band to it, buddy, because you better call it Van Halen's Cabo Wabo. And I'm going, oh,  that's fine. You know, so it's one of the problem. The guys are kind of into it and MTV jumped in it.  And we charted a big plane and threw all these celebrities down, have a big blowout party in them  after I left for dying. It wasn't somebody to really take care of the business of it.  They just weren't interested in and keeping the quality of the place. I was and I, you know, 
[53:00]
 you got to put new furniture in a place like that about every six months because people  trash on tequila, man. They're breaking everything. Every person I know is puked into Cabo Wabo.  So you have to keep it going. You know, they just weren't interested in keeping it alive.  And I love the place. And I go down there and jam with people. I just jam with John  and whistle down there two weeks ago with Matt Sorem and myself. We did a who set an hour and a  half impromptu places, about 400 people in there just sitting around dancing to whatever ACDC and 
[53:30]
 stuff with a box. All of a sudden we walk out there on stage, jump up, man. It's like, wow,  wow, man. I mean, you know, it's really cool to do that. They get a whole international clientele  down there. A lot of Americans are all Americans. Mostly American. Yeah. I mean, you get some people  from Mexico City and some, you know, rockers from Mexico over there, but it's a pretty isolated  little place there. Yeah. Cool. Well, let's take a quick break. We're going to break open the  tequila. You can have a few shots with us, Sammy. Well, not a few. I got to play some time. 
[54:00]
 Yeah. You play the Hard Rock Cafe tonight. It's going to be a great, great time. We're having  a party. What we're doing is going around the country. There's 13 Hard Rocks. Hard Rock Worldwide  love my tequila. And they want to put it in the bars. And they said, well, so would you come  around and promote it? And I said, well, if I can mix it with the new song and the record somehow,  but the album's not out yet, but we're going around. We're just playing parties. No tickets  of it. You can't buy a ticket. It's not for sale. It's a party. We've been giving away all week.  I don't want people puking on Elvis's jacket or anything. That's tequila though. 1027WNEW, 
[54:30]
 the Rock in New York. You're hanging with Opie and Anthony and Sammy Hagar. My records sound so bad.  What is he saying over there, Anthony? You ever blow your voice out? Oh, yeah. I mean,  because you're always balls out like that. I'm just wondering if you ever just went to  sing and nothing came out. Yeah, a few times, but that's usually from being sick. I don't usually  just blow my voice out completely because I have a pretty tough voice. But if you get sick, you get  a cold, you know, and then try to sing. Did you do any training or anything or that just came natural 
[55:00]
 from? No, it's kind of like I said, you know, it's like training is in the bottle. I trained on stage.  That's why it took me so long to make it. I did all that training, you know, as a professional.  Right. Well, can we try the tequila? Yeah, let's give it a whirl, man. Well, what are the  listeners? How are they going to know what this tastes like and it looks like? This blue bottle  looks like the ocean in Cabo. Okay, if you're sitting, you know, in an airplane, the beautiful  ocean, kind of turquoise, blue. It's got the whole pitch. And it's the smell. Now that was something 
[55:30]
 I like. We call it vitamin T. It's almost good for you. You don't need a salt, a lime. As the song  says, most tequila, take your vitamin T with salt and limon slice. A limon in Mexico, it's not a  lemon. A limon, you tell a guy you want a lemon, they give you a lime. I say, oh, I'll have a lime  and you still get a lime. It's a limon. Okay. Now you were telling me, Sammy's pouring them. 
[56:00]
 Pouring them, man. Okay. That's just a little bit. Now look, tonight I'm doing a little party  and I might be doing a lot of this later on, okay? A lot of it during the show and a lot of it after  the show. And I got to go have some kind of a system here, you know? But we're going tonight,  man. I want to check this out. Look at the line forming over here. Everyone's,  but listeners, you should see this line. You got to get this tequila. Is Gary, Gary, you having one?  Yeah, look at this. Gary, our boss is having one. Gary. It's Tequila Tuesday, everyone. 
[56:30]
 And since it's two for Tuesday, we're going to need another one. Look, I filled that one up real high  and everyone could pass it around. I'll tell you how. Wow. People are lined up outside the door.  All right. You know what I mean? You don't have to worry. It'll kill anything.  You can drink right after someone with the flu. It doesn't matter. Same cup. And we've never had  this many people in the studio. I think we got to have Tequila Tuesday every week. It's funny what  Tequila does. I always say at my club, you know, I'm saying, where's your favorite place to play 
[57:00]
 in the world? I say it's a cobble wobble. It's not because I own the place. It's because  everyone's drunk on Tequila. And when a bunch of people drunk on Tequila are a blast, you know,  it's like, you know, you get a bunch of 400 or 500 people drunk on beer in a room.  And what do they do? They start fighting. Tequila, man. People start taking their clothes off.  Well, we're hoping for that today. Now, I'm noticing the smell isn't the same as most Tequila I have had  because it doesn't smell all that strong. Look at them coming. It doesn't have this chemical smell. 
[57:30]
 No, there's no chemicals. This is pure. It's all natural. It's got to be good then, right?  Natural. No preservatives, no chemicals. Look at everybody coming in here to drink Tequila.  We honestly, someone has to take a picture. Like 20 people in here. We got about 20 people in the  studio. You guys blew it. I find it on this video. I would have started selling these shots.  You should have. How many more we got? How many more? We're going to do it. We're going to all  do it together. How many? Walk around the other way, guys. Oh, a couple of people got real big ones now.  My judgment was real bad on a couple of these pours. So now I'm going to do it. 
[58:00]
 Now, if anyone has to puke here, Ben, pull out the garbage.  You got a half full glass. Don't slam it. Now, problems. Sammy said you should use sea salt  because the salt with the chemicals like iodized, you know, that's not good. But I'm going to use  that anyway. Yeah, let me pass this test. And then a piece of lemon, which should be lime  because of the lime flavors in tequila and real tequila. Pure tequila has a little bit of lime 
[58:30]
 flavor and a little bit of salt flavor. So you want as pure salt as possible when you're using  a pure tequila and it's pure lime or lime, you know, right, nice, right lime. You think it'll do,  man? It's just, you know, you think anyone's good. You think anyone's listening to this anymore?  I have a feeling a couple of people just took off, went down to the liquor store.  They want to interactive radio. Anybody else more here?  Well, this is almost like a dream come true, man. I was doing shots of tequila at San Diego.  It's the next best thing to be in the Cabo Wabo. I'll tell you that. 
[59:00]
 All right. Is everyone ready? Yes. Wait, wait. You don't need salt.  What are they doing? This is good tequila, man. If you want to do it, you can, but you don't.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, Sammy, do a toast. All right, do a toast or something.  For the people. I raise a toast to peace, love and happiness  and most tequila. All right.  Wow. Oh man. Yeah. That'll make you happy. Wow. That'll make you happy. Let the party begin. 
[59:30]
 This room just came up a notch. Wow. Suddenly I want to hop in my car and drive over mailboxes.  That's the best tequila you've ever tasted. Wow. I like that. I like that a lot. That is good.  It'll burn in your stomach. I mean, it's alcohol, but man, but it's taste in your mouth is good.  It sure makes you salivate. Yeah. It gets all the juices flowing.  You're going to have your tongue down some girl's throat, man. Man, I'm telling you, you're there. 
[60:00]
 Right? Wow. That was good. I want to put M80s in mailboxes now.  Hey, Carrie, break open your bottle, man. What are you doing?  Oh, look, Carrie's, look at him. He's bone garnet. He's taking it home with him.  We'll get you another bottle. Was that it? That was the whole bottle?  That was the whole bottle. Wow. Look at that.  And I think that's backwash. A little bit in the bottom there.  All right, Sammy, you got to tell us about the new album. It's coming out what? March 23rd? 
[60:30]
 March 23rd. It's called Red Voodoo.  Yes. We've been playing Masta Killa here at  N.E.W. and getting lots of requests for it. Well, you know, it's pretty much a party record  and a party tune. And it's not that I tried to make that, you know, it's like March in the  March is a very serious record for me coming off the band heels. But I was a little angry  and had some little white eyes. I'll get out of it. You know, I take it out in my songs instead  of my wife, you know. So after that, you know, I put a new band together when I did 110 shows,  you know, the Wobble Readers and we played combo probably seven, eight times last year. 
[61:00]
 And I just started getting real festive about the whole thing. You know, it just started getting  better and better. Right. When you're when you're it's like a dog off the leash, man. You start  having fun, you know, going around sniffing everything, you know. So I was having a pretty  good time. And as when I started writing, it just started coming out. I just started writing down  in Cabo a lot. I started writing about the situation with the band. So we just got together at my house.  The whole band moved into my house and we wrote, produced and did the whole record at my house. 
[61:30]
 This is great. Screw that. I need another shot.  But it's a party record. Well, let's check out my fun. Let's check out most tequila here.  Right. It's Sammy Hagar off the. Wow. I'm already.  The Rock of New York, one oh two seven W.N.E.W. The latest from Sammy Hagar,  opposite the Red Voodoo, which comes out March twenty third. That's most tequila. 
[62:00]
 You're right there. Oh, yeah, I'm feeling a little better now.  Already. Oh, you mean it was cut.  It's funny because we're talking about Sammy's new CD Red Voodoo and I'm listening to him and  also I just started zoning out like it just came over me, man. That shot.  It was a good high. It's a spirit. Well, you poured me a double shot,  though. I must say. I mean, you did the whole thing. Yes. Yeah. The beginning of the bottle,  people got the bigger shots than at the end of the bottle where we had to ration it out.  But I got to tell you, I got the first first cupful. 
[62:30]
 It was funny about five months ago, six months ago, I when the tequila first came to America,  when the first dates we came to is back here in New York and I came back with the tequila  company and we went around and had a bartender convention here outside of town by the airport  and we invited all the bartenders because I have a drink that's made of this called a wobble.  Rita, which is the name of your host to make those for us today. Well, it's a straight up  like a martini served tight margarita instead of, you know, it's shaken and but it's got a 
[63:00]
 couple of other mixtures in it and it's got to be done right. The recipes on this little tag on the  bottle. So I wanted to show all the bartenders how to how to make a wobble. Rita. So we had 150  bartenders in a room and I got up there and I showed them how to make a wobble. Rita. And then  we just made a bunch of them and just got to rat. I mean, to rat left this down and went to another  state, you know, and did the same thing over and over again. I want to tell you something that was  about four days of a blur. So now you got to watch it in New York because they take your car away. 
[63:30]
 If you're driving. Well, good. Now, look, see now that you have a license.  He's got a couple strikes. Really? Look, my whole trip is, although I can't drive 55.  Yeah, I tell everyone I said, oh, no, no, that's that's no longer represent Sammy here. Now I'm  represented by most tequila. You know, represents my life for the next 10 years.  And I try not to mix it. It's like go out and get plastered and then drive fast.  Oh boy. Yeah. The cops must have pulled you over and like, oh, look at Sammy Hagar. 
[64:00]
 I can't drive 55. Most of the other day says, you know, I used to always say, you know, a couple  for me are say, oh man, you know, I couldn't see that. I didn't know how fast I was going or  whatever. Yeah. Just tell them, no, man. Hey, I've been drinking so much tequila.  I couldn't see the speedometer. I'm going, yeah, that'll work. Yeah, that's why. Yeah.  The mayor's loving you right now. Yeah. They take your car now in New York. If you're,  if you're driving this town, you guys are crazy to drive in this town, man. I get in the back of a  taxi. Well, that's that seems close. Where are you going? Take a couple of whacks and you mind if I 
[64:30]
 take the sidewalk? It's fun, man. All right. Everyone wants to talk to Sammy. Let's grab a  few folks. Sure. Let's talk to some listeners. These people got to say hi. Any W. Hi,  sir. Yeah. You're live on the air with Sammy Hagar. That's the Hagar squeal. It's a phenomenon. We  hear obviously she's been drinking. I'm only 15. I haven't been drinking. So don't start now. Okay. 
[65:00]
 Listen, don't get me in trouble with your mom now. You know, really? How are you? I'm good. How are  you? Pretty good. What are your top five favorite bands? Right now, my favorite band is Tool.  I really am. We love Tool. I think it's about the coolest band happening right now. The most  innovative, best sounding, weirdest, you name it. I just really dig Tool. And after that, geez,  man, I don't know. I mean, I'm Peter Gabriel fan, which is Tool Peter Gabriel. Take that tequila 
[65:30]
 away from this guy. But I don't know. It's just off the top of my head. Sorry, no Hanson or N-Sync.  I don't like them. They suck. All right. Well, thank you. Thank you. All right. Bye.  Hi, any W. Hey, what's up, guys? What's going on? All right. You having fun or what?  Everything's good, man. This is the first time I've ever sat in a radio station and got liquored up. 
[66:00]
 I'm sorry. One thing before I ask you a question, I agree with you. Every time I see David Lee  Warrick, you see a constipated dog shaking his leg. Oh, my goodness. I didn't say that.  You agree with me. Now, wait a minute. You agree with me as if I said that. No, no, no. The way  he looked on the video and music awards. Oh, yeah. That was pretty rough, man. That was rough.  Listen, my name's Peter from Wontore. I've seen you at Jones Beach just tons of times. I've seen  you at Cal Sea in the Garden and whatnot. But I got to ask you, I don't know if you've been,  you know, a call or whatnot, but at Jones Beach, you guys always seem to be on fire, particularly 
[66:30]
 you. Do you like big playing down there or whatnot? Do you even know? I like venues like that. You know,  to me, being a singer, it's much more fun to sing and a little more relaxed on your voice to sing  outside and especially when there's a little ocean air and stuff and some kind of moisture in the air  because you get inside of a building where there's been 18,000 people and they're breathing up all the  good air and smoking cigarettes all night. By the time I get up there, they've been in there seven,  eight hours, doing a lot left. It's hard on your voice. It really is. So I really enjoy open air. 
[67:00]
 And I remember last time Jones Beach, we had a big rain and I don't know if you were there when it  rained. Yeah, we were there. So I jumped out in the rain with y'all and ruined my cordless microphone.  It's cost me about five thousand bucks. Hey, man, but you know, you guys always run a good show and  I'm looking forward to the new record and have fun tonight. Thank you very much. Take care from this  new record and good luck, brother. It's a rocker for you, man. All right, man. Stay with these guys.  These guys are the best in New York. I know they're cracking me up. I'm having the best time. I've  had a radio in years. You will. Take care. Have a good talk. Hey, thanks, buddy. 
[67:30]
 Howard, treat you good this morning. You know, he didn't he went too hard on me. He kind of endorsed  me for the first time and now he's on my side. You see, you know, before, well, he's like, you know,  he plays Roth. He was on Roth's side. Now he's on my side. He always likes the guy that's kind of out  in the cold. Well, we grew up in New York. So obviously we listened to Howard and I remember  him bashing you on one video. It was, you know, one, one, one. He's got his head buried up  the ass of Eddie Van Halen on one of the videos. Look at him. What is he kissing his asses? 
[68:00]
 Yeah, Howard's silly, man. You know, first time I went in there, I was really upset. You know,  I was going to go in there and just really get his case, you know, and he kind of disarmed me  before the thing. He was real nice to me. Yeah, but you know what happened? Because I heard that  because I remember that whole thing. He's kind of a phony though, because as soon as you left,  then he trashed you. Well, we did. I was always wondering if people listen after. Right. I did  exactly why, because he did, you know, because that one time he was kissing your ass saying how 
[68:30]
 David Lee Roth sucks. As soon as you left the studio, he starts trashing you and saying,  man, you know, let's get David Lee Roth on the phone. I was like, what a pussy, man. You had  Sammy right there telling how you really feel. But that was, that was a few years back. He's a funny  guy. All right. You know, he's got an advantage. First of all, you got to realize something.  Seven o'clock in the morning, Sammy Hagar on the East Coast. I'm a West Coast person. Oh yeah.  From Cabo. That was three o'clock in the morning. Wake up. I wasn't quite ready. I was a little  grogged out, a little slowed down. Right. After I left, I come up with some of the best answers. 
[69:00]
 All right. You got a question for Sammy? Yeah. How you doing? All right. Hey,  Albie. How are you today? Hey, how's it going, buddy? Hey, Sammy. How you doing?  I'm doing pretty good. Hey, listen, man. I just want to say you guys are great, man. I mean,  I love listening to your show and Sammy, let me say something. You're great. I love your voice.  I mean, I got albums of you. I mean, I even go back to when you were in Montrose. Wow. Wow.  That far back when you were playing, when you were doing, you know, rock and roll,  motor scooter, number five. I mean, incredible, you know? I mean, I think, you know, personally, 
[69:30]
 what they, you know, they got this other guy playing for Van Halen. Thanks, man. I don't know.  I don't think you're very much, man. It's a very high compliment. I mean, really.  Well, people don't people, people, a lot of people, I guess, don't realize you had a huge  career before Van Halen, you know? Yeah. People forget that sometimes, you know? Yeah. The red  rocker. Everywhere but New York City. Yeah. It was a funny thing, you know, as a solo artist  throughout my career, I was, you know, I headline, you know, arenas everywhere and I would never come 
[70:00]
 to New York because the first time I came here, I opened for Kiss. Well, not the first time as a  solo artist. Montrose, I actually played here for the Who one time, but I opened for Kiss and I got  booed off the stage at Massacre. Get out of here. What happened? Off the stage by the third song,  I pulled down my pants. I gave it a little shake at them. I smashed the guitar up and I said,  you people, right? And I split and I said, I'll never play that city again. Wow. I'm serious. And 
[70:30]
 I came back with the group Boston about, you know, five or six years later and I said,  okay, I'll try it again. Try it again here. Open for them was kind of a mediocre response,  but I made it through the sad. Who were you opening for when they booed you? Kiss. Oh,  Kiss. That was way back in the old days, you know, 77 or something, 76. Oh, yeah. Any body up there  before Kiss would have gotten booed off. It was rough, man. Oh, that rough. You know, so, you know, 
[71:00]
 I had kind of a, I was nervous, you know, I didn't really, and then, you know, through Van Halen, we,  you know, did really well here all them years. I'm over it now. I'm okay. But I skipped over,  you know, three lock box, VOA, you know, to ask the promoters around here. I just played. I played  outside of here anywhere. I did not play on a deal. And then on the earth to be rough, weird thing,  you know, for me. Hi, any W. Hey, Sammy. Yeah. I want to let you know that I'm sure a lot of people  stroke your ego a lot, but no one's ever going to confuse you with wrong. I'm going to talk to Van 
[71:30]
 Halen for a quick second. Then I'm going to ask you a question. What you brought to the band  was a great musician and a hell of a voice. Thank you very much. You showed growth on every album  and you peaked with balance. Terrific, terrific vocals and music on that album. That's pretty  profound. Quick question. And it was 11 years of Van Halen. I saw every show with you.  What's the difference now torn with the band? I'm sure they're your friends,  but after spending so much time with a group of guys, we seem to have so much fun together 
[72:00]
 and so much respect for one another. What's the difference now?  He's making me tear up. You know, there really isn't a lot of difference because when you put  a band together of people that you really enjoy and love to play with, it's really the same.  My new band is that they're just that I have the same feelings with these guys as I did with Van  Halen. The difference was with Van Halen is that we were four really strong, equal individuals 
[72:30]
 that were really individuals. And when we got together, a special thing happened. And it's like  being a solo artist is different from that. Van Halen was a chemistry of four people. And as you  see, one person leaves and the chemistry changes. That's totally true. And I tell you what, I think  they probably would have been better off doing an instrumental album because after having you in the  band, there was no place to go but down. Where are you in the monkey cage? 
[73:00]
 But the thing is, I'm a father now. So am I. But when you're a solo artist, the difference is  is that you can kind of do anything you want when you want to do it. And it's a lot purer.  There you go. I like that. I like that. That makes me homesick, buddy. Put her on the phone.  I think I'm going to take you for a while to watch my son.  All right, buddy. That's good.  Okay, keep rocking today. How old are you?  How old is your kid?  Mine? Oh, three. I have a three-year-old daughter. I heard that scream. I assumed it was a girl. 
[73:30]
 You know, the little daughters are squealing all the time.  Would that totally change your life?  Oh, yeah, man. It kind of hooks you right up. You know what it does? It gets your priorities  straight. All this time you think about me, me, me, me, even with your wife. You fall in love.  You think you're just so in love with your wife. All right, oh, man, just love her more than anything  in the world. And then, but it's still me, me, me. It's like, show me how much you love me all the  time. That's what it's all about, right? It's like, you know, you're never sure that she loves you  enough. Well, you know, and you want her to show you so much how much she loves you so that you can 
[74:00]
 let go and show her, right? Did Sammy have to take the garbage out and stuff? I take the garbage out.  Did you get the edge? Sammy Hagar, vacuum the carpet. No, no. Could you tell her that?  But when you have- That's my wife right there. Leave him alone.  But when you have a baby- Sammy Hagar told you.  When you have a baby and that little head pops out and you see that little face, I'm telling you,  you are changed up. It's no longer me, me, me. It's like, I'll do anything for this thing. I'm  going to make sure this human being is safe, happy. And I mean, you know, I swear, it's just like, 
[74:30]
 you just, you know the true meaning of love. It's about giving, not taking. And a baby to me  did that for me. And it's wonderful. Wow.  Man, I'm down with it. Hey, you have a question for Sammy?  I heard you being a selfish piece of crap. I can try to take too long. I'm a volunteer  fireman. I got a house burning down. Whoa. Are you serious? Yeah.  Burning down the house. Wait, are you on the way to the fire?  I worked on a street. I'm at work. I've been out of work for like 45 minutes 
[75:00]
 and we got a fire, but I wanted to ask my question.  Three,  five,  six,  six,  six,  six,  six,  six,  six,  six,  six,  six,  six,  six,  six,  six,  six,  six,  six,  six,  six,  six,  six,  six,  six,  six,  six,  six,  six,  six,  six,  six,  six,  I heard you talk, you just seem like such a big man about everything that happened. And I think  that's really cool. But I was like, especially earlier when you were still all kind of PO'd about,  and you decided to go solo. Did somebody call you up and want to be your drinking buddy and like 
[75:30]
 pissed off? You know, it's the only thing pissed off this bad mouth everybody.  Yeah. Did anybody call you up? Who's like, Hey, come on, I'm going to sit in the  front and get some beer.  You insane? Not a question is that I had a couple of friends. You know, that's a really,  that's a pretty unique question because it's true. You know, you know, I had a couple of  friends like, you know, publicly, everyone told me, all my professional people, you know,  my manager, my lawyer, you know, don't go bash them. Take the high road, Sammy, take the high road.  I'm going, you know, and it's like, so, but I had a couple of friends that I could sit down 
[76:00]
 with and say, man, you know, we didn't necessarily get trashed into it, but we just did it. It just  would turn that way. And there was a couple of people that, uh, uh, now there was a guy that  used to make Eddie's guitars. I'll even say it was straight up, man. He was the guy who used to make  Eddie's original guitar. And then Eddie got in a big beef. So this guy, wait, wait, wait, there  we go. Back up like five seconds. At least you know, Sammy's getting comfortable. 
[76:30]
 No. So this guy, man, he was, he was upset with Eddie very much. So right. And Eddie left the  company and started another guitar company and endorsed another guitar. And me and this guy,  we got together on it, man. We went off, man. I'm telling you, he told me stories and I told him  stories. It was, it was actually, it was inventing, you know, it was really therapy,  you know, it's helping. I actually felt a lot better after that. I think a lot of people want  to see a pay-per-view you and, uh, David Lee Ross. I'd be like the Tyson Spinks fight. 72 seconds 
[77:00]
 of the first round. All right, man.  Six, five, one, engine 51, fire in progress.  Hi, Eddie W. Hi. I have a question for Sammy. How are you doing, Sam? I'm doing great now.  Man, you're the best. I just want to say that you're a lot better, um, for Van Halen than David Lee  Ross ever was. Wow. Revelation. It's so funny, man. It's like, all this is coming around now. 
[77:30]
 You guys should have popped up, you know, but no, thank you very much. I think the Roth error was  very good. It just was different, you know, like I said, sure. He's different. There's three  different errors down every new guy in a band like Van Halen, cause it's a chemistry band. It's not  about one guy's solo trip and, uh, it, it makes, it just makes for chemistry and each guy's different.  So it was two different bands when you think about it. I have a question about when you play  your own, do you play any VH songs that you play with them? Oh yeah. Like tonight we're doing this 
[78:00]
 party over the hard rock. Uh, I'll probably do maybe three, you know, we're playing about an hour  20 or so. We don't play a long time because it's just a party, you know, and everybody's so drunk  by the time we finish, we play as long as we can. Okay. And, uh, uh, it's kind of like, uh,  yeah, maybe I'll play three Van Halen songs. And when I do my normal two and a half, three hour show,  I'll play like six or seven Van Halen songs and couple Montrose tunes. And I tried tonight. It's  really kind of like a, a greatest hit set, you know, it's got, you know, all the, all the hits 
[78:30]
 from my past career and, uh, all three of them and they're all three Van Halen songs. Isn't that weird?  And when are you touring on your own? Um, the tour starts May 1st actually. And I think we'll be up  here in the summer. Awesome. All right, man. Thanks for having me here. Thank you. All right.  I don't know. Do you have to leave or? Yeah, I'm having so much fun though, man. It's just,  but we just, everything else I have to do. Let's just bring them down. Yeah. 
[79:00]
 We got the booze here. We got a good company. You can't leave. You brought the beer,  tequila actually. It's kind of like the guy in the band who can't, you can't fire him because he has  the truck and the equipment. Yeah. I think that's how Roth got the job. And I didn't read that.  Didn't he have a PA or something? I swear to God, I'm not joking. That it was like, that was  the deal. I read that he was doing disco tunes. Yeah. Michael Anthony and Eddie were the original  singers, right? Which is there tape for that? I don't know. I love to dig some of that. Yeah. 
[79:30]
 They told me those stories themselves. And then Roth had a truck and a PA, a band and a PA. And  it's like, Hey, you want to be in our band? What do you do? It doesn't matter. You got the equipment.  Cal bell. You're in. All right. I guess we got to let them leave. All right. So happy to be here.  It's been a great thing. This is Sammy Hagar. I want to sign off with you people, but don't change  the dial because I think they're going to play some more of my music. I'm going to do like a  dinner at Howard. I'm going to listen to you guys on the way out. We're going to come out of commercials 
[80:00]
 and say, you know, you suck. Oh, come on. We would never do that.  No, we're a little, we're real here, man. All right. Well, Sammy, thank you, man. The new CD  comes out March 23rd. It's a red voodoo playing the hard rock cafe tonight. And we're playing  most of killer here on the radio. A lot of people love it. So for home delivery, call 1-800-NY-TIME  People just yapping. See what tequila does to everyone. Everyone's towels now. 
[80:30]
 I'm going to go downstairs for a cigarette. Yeah. Well, we got to thank Sammy Hagar for stopping by.  Honestly, God, he's a great guy. What a blast. He's awesome. Cart Blonde. She can come back  anytime. All right. Some of that tequila with him. And then here's something a little different.  Let's play some music today. That's right. That's right. The last hour and a half since  Johnny line came in has been a complete blur. The rock of New York, 1027, WNEW, two for Tuesday 
[81:00]
 with the black crows track from by your side. That's only a fool. And now let's again from the  first one. It's Opie and Anthony and Ralph the tour in the studio. I'm buddy our pal. Hey, listen,  you son of a bitch. I don't need this crap anymore. I'm not going to take this to watch the  game. You can kiss my ass. What? What? You want to fight? You're a fireman. What do you want to  fight me? Well, you're not good enough to shake my hand. I'm not good enough for you anymore. 
[81:30]
 We will tell me I'll kick, kick your ass. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look, give me a hug.  You're like, you're like my best friend. I'm sorry. I call you out. I call you out, man. Come here.  Yeah. That was good stuff. Yeah. When do you get to go to work and, and do shots of tequila  with Sammy Hagar when you're a DJ in New York? It's just amazing. I'm stunned. That was great.  Yeah, that was good. Ralph, you have fun? Oh, great time. Yeah. Did you get one? Did you get 
[82:00]
 one of the early shots of tequila? I got one of the early cups. Yeah. I got about half full.  I got to tell you guys. These are coffee cups. You should tell them. These are coffee cups.  When he started pouring, there were only about five of us in the studio. Then when we're talking,  more people started coming in, so we had to make the shots smaller. But the ones that got them first,  which is Ralph, me, and Alvin, they were pretty full. They released double shots or shots.  Yeah. I was just saying before Sammy came in that I can't do tequila anymore. I had a bad 
[82:30]
 experience way, way, way back. I really haven't drank it since. Were you going to re-experience?  Well, I didn't want to be a pussy. So I got to slam the shot. Sammy's here. He poured me a shot.  You can't punk out in front of Hagar with his own tequila. What are you going to do, punk out?  He doesn't have the shot glass. He's just pouring whatever he felt like in the coffee cups. So I  drank it. For a split second, I'm like, oh man, this stuff's coming up. No way. Oh, dude, if you 
[83:00]
 would've hurled it. No, but honestly, I really like the tequila. But just because of the experience  way back when, just a hint of the tequila, maybe think about it. But you're okay now. Yeah, I'm  fine now. It's wonderful tequila. It really is. Cabo Wabo tequila, is that what it is? Tequila  Tuesdays. There you go. Let's have tequila Tuesdays, everybody. No, but he's a good example of one of  the guys that have been in the business for a lot of years. And it's not like when the newbie bands 
[83:30]
 come in and they act like asses. Third Eye Blank. But you hear what Eddie was saying? But he's honest.  He's really honest. He comes in and pretty much told the story with the Van Halen. And there's no  real BS coming out of him. I liked it. He's a good guy. He's a good man too. He's playing blackjack  with Eddie in Atlantic City. Eddie, grab that mic. He didn't know how to play blackjack. Tell him the  story. I went to see this thing that he's doing tonight. It's a Sunday night. He played down in  Atlantic City at the Taj. And afterwards, at the end of the show, he said, I don't see you guys at 
[84:00]
 the tables. Now, everybody would say that. I'll see you later, whatever. And down at the tables,  I'm sitting there playing blackjack. He pulls up the chair next to me. And he's like, I've been a  Sammy Hagar fan since Montrose's first record. So I'm like, this is cool. Starts ordering drinks.  Where's the waitress? Where's the drink service? And he's betting pretty heavy hands. Obviously,  he can swing. He's got a couple of boxes. So I'm playing the table minimum and I'm just hanging  out. I'm losing my shirt. But Sammy, as much as I love the guy, doesn't really know how to play 
[84:30]
 blackjack because he'll have an 11 and not know to double down. And he's got like 300 out there.  And on one hand, he had like 300 bucks. And he drew an 11 and the dealer had a three show. And  he's just like, I'll stand. No, no. Oh, double down. Sammy, you gotta double down. And he goes,  that's 300 bucks. It's a 600 on hand. Sammy, you gotta play by the rules. So he slides out,  $600 hand. Of course he wins. He takes some chips. He starts throwing them over. 
[85:00]
 It was really cool. He's like the most down to earth, greatest guy.  I always have fun with Sammy on the radio. First time a rock star ever paid me, you know,  all these years growing up buying his records and stuff. I got a little kickback.  I mean, we got to thank Johnny Lang for coming by, Sammy Engar. We didn't even get to half the  stuff we wanted to do today. Who won by the way? Opie won the Brabingo. Yeah, we had a Brabingo  game today and Opie won. See, we needed to do the Brabingo while we were drinking the tequila. It 
[85:30]
 would have been much more fun. It would have been very hard to keep track of. That's true.  We had want. That's true. But also we asked the listeners to send in their favorite  Slim Pickens movie lines. I don't know how we got on this. Oh, Stanley Kubrick.  You know what happened? Yeah, Stanley Kubrick dying and Joe DiMaggio got all the press.  But we were saying how brilliant Slim Pickens was. Well, did you see the Screen Actors Guild 
[86:00]
 awards? No. Roberto, I always screw up his last name. From Life is Beautiful. He won and he paid  homage to the Maestro as he called him. Because it just happened that day. It wasn't even really  in print or anything. So he got a little coverage. Okay. Well, I don't think he was getting all the  recognition that he needed. But Dr. Strangelove, one of the movies he directed, Slim Pickens riding  the nuclear warhead down. Wasn't that great? He's riding the nuclear warhead down. But then we 
[86:30]
 started talking about Slim Pickens and Blazing Saddles. Another great movie that would never,  ever, ever be made today because of all the racial overtones in it. Richard Pryor, a writer  on Blazing Saddles. I didn't know that until they roasted Richard Pryor recently.  I mean, what do you think? Mel Brooks was coming up with all the black jokes in that?  You know what? There was a scene in there where the lights go down and he's in the room. 
[87:00]
 The sheriff. Madeline Kahn.  Madeline Kahn and-  Cleabond Little.  Cleabond Little, right. And as you go, oh, you're so big. And the next line,  which was cut from the movie was, baby, you suck it on my arm.  That was cut from the movie?  Cut and said, oh, you suck it on my elbow.  Look at that.  So everyone sent in their Slim Pickens lines. Okay. That's how we got on this subject. Slim  Pickens, Blazing Saddles lines. Well, you want to hear a couple of them here, Anthony?  Yeah, let's hear. All right. Here's another one. 
[87:30]
 I know how we can run everybody out of Rockridge.  How?  We'll kill the first born male child in every household.  Too Jewish.
