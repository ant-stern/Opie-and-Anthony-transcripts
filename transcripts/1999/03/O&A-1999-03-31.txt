 are a mightier than each of them individually.  I agree.  Yes.  And after the mess that Van Halen put out last year, I think they'd be open to the idea.  Eee.  You know, and if David Lee Roth wasn't such a mess, I guarantee they would tour with David  Lee Roth at this point.  He's just a mess though, yeah, you're right.  He's not going to be able to do anything for that band, so.  No.  I'm going to predict Sammy Hagar joins Van Halen.  You think so?  Within the next few months.  Yeah.  Within the next few months.  Yeah, I think you're right.  All right. 
[00:30]
 What's up?  Look at this day.  Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm.  All I can say is wow, what a day.  Yeah, spring has sprung.  Obviously.  You're out there, you're doing this a lot.  You're taking it all in, the smell of spring.  It's warm, it's not even the least bit of a chill.  No.  It's totally gone, any bit of chill, you're in a t-shirt, doesn't matter.  Exactly.  The girls, the jackets are off.  I like this.  They're still not in total summer mode. 
[01:00]
 Yeah, but you just get that tingle all over your body when you get to see the women again  without as much clothes on.  Well, I tell you, it's not as painful now when you get stopped at a light.  Like we cruise up 57th Street and you get stopped at the light.  If you're the first guy in line.  We pray to be the first car online now.  Yeah, that way when the pedestrians are crossing the street, you get the front row view of  the lovely ladies.  I've got to confess, you see a lady, she's just got a t-shirt on and you're dying inside. 
[01:30]
 Yeah, that's good.  It's been a long, what, six months without seeing foreign women.  Well, they all bundled up for the winter, yes.  Now they're starting to shed the coats, Opie.  Right.  It's beautiful weather out.  I don't know, I think we can do better.  I think a lot of guys appreciate the lighter clothing on the girls and the view that they  get from the lighter clothing.  Correct. 
[02:00]
 But I know we can do better.  What are you getting at, Ant?  Well, that's what wow is all about.  Let us unveil wow to New York.  To New York on this day.  Well, you think wow would work as well down here as it did in Boston when we were up there  for three years?  Oh, I think so.  I definitely think so.  Where the whole city lost its S over our little promotion?  Yeah, well, it takes a while to catch on.  happens the first day that it's thrown out there.  But you've got to start somewhere and you have to start on the first nice Wednesday 
[02:30]
 of the year and this is it.  So we can break it out today.  This wow has been written about all over America as the greatest radio promotion ever made.  Everyone can be involved.  It doesn't matter where you are.  Doesn't even matter if you're listening to the station, which was the most amazing thing.  I think it got to the point where people who didn't have a clue who opium Anthony  were knew what wow was right just because of the word amount. 
[03:00]
 It's it's part of folklore up in Boston now and well, we'll give it a try down here and  see what happens.  Well, wow stands for whip them out Wednesday.  That is what wow is.  That sounds a little crazy.  I understand.  It sounds a little nuts.  You're right.  But if you want to talk to some of the people we we turn on to wow, trust me, it works.  Now the the nice weather comes around so you don't have to worry about catching a chill.  The guys driving home in rush hour traffic. 
[03:30]
 It's a bitch.  We try with the radio show to to make the drive home a little better.  Right.  But it's just it's horrible.  The traffic correct.  You're just wishing there was something that could take your mind off of the idiot in front  of you and the traffic and the accidents and this that and the other thing.  So now if you're driving you're stuck in traffic.  You turn to your side and you see a lady flash you.  Oh my God.  What would that be the best thing?  We have just made that guy's life.  He goes home and I didn't know what you're just sitting behind the wheel. 
[04:00]
 You're miserable.  Put yourself there.  You're miserable.  You look over.  There's a lovely lady next to you in the car next to you.  She looks at you and pulls her shirt up revealing her bosom to you.  Now you drive home.  You're smiling thinking about this the whole ride home.  You've got to tell someone.  You call your friend.  Hey Artie a girl out of nowhere flashed me on the way home on the way home and guys love  foreign boo sightings.  Right.  Love it. 
[04:30]
 Now you're seeing breasts on the highway.  This is the essence of Whippam out Wednesday.  Wow.  That's what we call it.  Ed.  Hello.  Hey what's up Ed.  Oh wait wait wait wait.  All right.  Hold on.  I'm going to pop these down.  Ed.  Yeah.  What's going on?  It's a beautiful day out for a while.  Let me tell you.  It certainly is.  It is a Whippam out Wednesday kind of day.  Oh okay.  I was down in San Antonio a few years ago.  A friend of mine was from Boston.  This guy Dave. 
[05:00]
 Saw it.  He used to do that.  He told us about it.  We went out down the river walk doing it.  Yeah.  Worked beautiful.  Yeah believe it or not the ladies have no problem doing this.  No they love it.  They love it.  They see attention I think.  It's attention.  It's a freeing experience.  That certainly is.  And they're making guys happy all over the New York area.  And this is on a volunteer basis.  We're not forcing the ladies to do it.  Oh of course.  Of course.  I mean they're more than happy.  If my girlfriend's listening I think she should be doing that too.  And we don't want the guys to harass the ladies you know. 
[05:30]
 No not at all.  This is a wonderful thing.  It's just a simple thing.  It's very nice.  It's very friendly and it makes everyone happy.  Now throughout Whippam out Wednesdays as they continue throughout the summer months we give  sightings.  We put up a big map on the wall here at Whippam out Wednesday Central and then we take pins  and pop them in whenever someone calls with a sighting of breasts. 
[06:00]
 And then we can report the concentrated areas of sightings.  So that way if someone's like I'm on the Jersey turnpike and you know you give us the exit  and we pop the pin there.  It's like that Regis and Cathy Lee map but ours is much better.  Much better.  Much better.  That's good that way you have an idea what to do on Wednesday if you're sitting around  and you're bummed out.  Right.  Also there's a boob index.  Let us talk about the boob index.  That has to do with weather.  This I didn't know about.  Now Whippam out Wednesdays every Wednesday through the summer but some days it's going 
[06:30]
 to be raining.  Now that's not a very high boob index.  You're not going to get a lot of sightings.  True.  True.  So on Wednesdays we'll report the boob index.  And let me tell you for today the boob index is about an eight.  Oh I'd say it's about an eight.  It is a pretty high today.  Oh yeah.  It's beautiful after that.  Yes.  All right Ed.  All right.  So you guys keep up the good work.  You guys are kicking ass.  Let me tell you.  Hey thanks buddy.  All right take care.  Bye.  Now the way guys are identified that they want to see boobs on the highway because you 
[07:00]
 can't have girls flashing every car.  It could be a priest in one car for God's sake.  Correct.  But we got to start somewhere so the ladies just got to start flashing right now.  Just start flashing.  We encourage people to put wow on their car in any way shape or form.  So then the ladies know that that's a wow participant that would like to see something  and vice versa.  The tractor trailer drivers are the best because they have the dirty back of the truck and  they could just put a huge wow on the back.  Right.  And then we've gotten so many truck drivers that put the wow on the back and say that 
[07:30]
 girls just pass the truck beep.  They look down.  Boom.  Get the flash shot.  And then they're out of there.  Yeah it takes two seconds.  Two seconds to make someone happy.  Yeah what we need from the girls today to start this whole thing off is if you see a  guy maybe you like him.  Maybe you think he's a cute guy.  Driving down the road maybe a guy looks so frustrated from the traffic.  Give him a show.  Give him a little flash.  And then just drive off. 
[08:00]
 You had your little moment.  And if the ladies want to call up if they want to participate and you're in your car  with a car phone you could call us up and we'll walk you through it.  We'll walk you through the flashing and we'll hear the sounds of it on the highway.  Any girls that want to participate in this today.  Yeah give us a call.  And if the guys see anything out there on the highway they're encouraged to call us  to let us know.  Call with a report.  Exactly.  Exciting.  That's what wow is about.  Hi.  That's what wow is about.  Hi.  That's what wow is about.  Hi. 
[08:30]
 That's what wow is about.  Hi.  That's what wow is about.  Hi.  That's what wow is about.  Hi.  That's what wow is about.  Hi.  It's the open Anthony show.  It has officially started today.  It takes a while to gain momentum people.  We realize this but we have to start somewhere and this is it.  So proceed to start whipping them out.  And who will be the first lady to.  I want to hear this cell phone.  Yeah.  First girl to get get him out there.  Right.  To start it off for us.  Throw out the first boobs of the season. 
[09:00]
 There you go.  The phones going nuts.  We'll go to the next see if anyone's doing this.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Has begun in New York City.  I am so happy now.  I feel like we are.  We're home.  Well we're taking a chance though because we almost got fired for this at the last station  but yeah because when this really starts catching on people really get pissed.  Well yeah the special interest group.  So yeah.  Yeah.  Robert first sighting.  Come on that quick.  No way.  Robert.  Hello. 
[09:30]
 What's up.  Where you calling from.  I'm calling from the Bronx.  That's where I work.  OK.  I'm over in the spot for Avenue there.  Lafayette and Hunts Point section of the Bronx.  Just now.  Yeah.  Just now.  Now.  Give us the details.  Well I was coming back after seeing a client and there they were.  Wow.  OK.  It was pretty cool.  Well I guess it happened before 3.  I think so.  All right.  So you're not the first official guy.  All right.  Well.  You just saw some errant boobs on a prostitute I think. 
[10:00]
 I think so.  All right.  All right guys.  Have a good one.  Thanks a lot.  Bye bye.  All right.  Very cool.  Uh oh.  What.  We'll take a break.  What.  I don't know.  I see Scott Herman walk in.  When we're discussing this I say uh oh.  All right Anthony MapQuest dot com.  MapQuest we love the people at MapQuest dot com.  There's no need to get lost anymore.  Wherever you want to go in the United States of America whether it's to a restaurant for  the evening or on a long trip where you know taking the kids to the Grand Canyon like the 
[10:30]
 Brady's did.  Remember that old guy.  That was a great episode.  Uh you go to MapQuest dot com.  Bobby and Cindy getting lost.  They should have had MapQuest.  MapQuest dot com instead of the little engine kid they had.  Yeah take a ride at the cactus.  Go to the stream.  Right exactly.  Well it wouldn't have gotten lost.  But uh MapQuest dot com you put in your destination.  You put in where you're leaving from.  And uh MapQuest gives you step by step text directions with mileage markers where you're 
[11:00]
 going to make your right turn.  Keep looking at every right turn until Smith Street comes up.  Correct.  It says one point five miles turn right on Smith Street.  Correct.  And it gives you a graphic map too of the whole area.  It's easy and it's free.  That's right.  No charge.  It's a brilliant idea.  These guys got to be billionaires.  While we were looking at smut on the internet when the internet was young they were planning  MapQuest dot com.  That's why they're doing well.  And uh where where where we are.  All right.  So it's Anthony and in the studio the big boss man Scott Herman. 
[11:30]
 He gave he walked in the studio and gave us this look.  We're like uh oh he's got to tell us something.  Hello boys.  Hey how you doing.  What's um what's up.  Remember what tomorrow is.  Tomorrow would be uh April first the first of April.  Now remember a year ago.  Well a year ago.  Let's see what.  That was also April first.  So this is the official reminder.  The last April Fool's Day will not be duplicated. 
[12:00]
 Well uh.  Remember who went out on a limb and saved you and rescued you.  You did us a favor.  Now we will in turn return that favor.  Oh yeah.  To you.  I will be as stupid as the last G.  I will be here tomorrow.  Well last year was the big day for Anthony and I.  Yeah that's uh.  That was I got the phone call in the morning from Opie.  It was a memorable phone call.  Anthony. 
[12:30]
 Yeah.  Huh.  Why.  I'm still asleep by the way.  I got an idea for April Fool's Day.  All right Hope what do you got.  We get on the air.  You know how all the other stations do those wacky goofy stupid April Fool's Day.  Yeah yeah why why.  We are going to go on the air and really play it up like the mayor of Boston is dead.  He died in a car crash because he's in Florida.  Well well that's great okay good night.  If I had two more seconds to think it over I would have said what do you want some form 
[13:00]
 of narcotics.  I thought it would be fun.  Oh it was fun all right.  What a great year that was after that.  But uh okay so we've been warned by uh Don Herman.  You know Don Herman told us not to make a move this April 1st.  Well he's kind of scared he wants to give us the day off.  What would you want to give us a day off.  I'm trying to think of what's worse.  What.  Having you here tomorrow and not having you here tomorrow.  You'll know on the second. 
[13:30]
 I should have given him the tail.  No we'll be good tomorrow.  I think we're just going to do a little recap.  We'll play some clips of uh of last year's show.  What we did last year.  And what really got us in trouble.  Maybe some of the news clips.  We have about a hundred of them.  Funny news clips of anchorman just disgusted with us.  They were on the news talking about opium Anthony saying the mayor's dead and then editorializing  like you know I hope their parents are proud like.  And then they do a story about a murderer and they're just no emotion nothing. 
[14:00]
 We were worse to them than the murder.  Now what time did you go in the air last year.  Was it four o'clock in the afternoon.  No three o'clock.  Three o'clock.  So at what point that day did you know that your career in Boston was over.  Uh honestly we thought we were going to skate.  Yeah it was looking good.  Yeah because we were like unstoppable up there.  Up until we realized there was no other news happening and then they really started snowballing.  We noticed like it was making the five o'clock six o'clock news eleven o'clock news and then  it was just snowballing.  Yeah.  And when the mayor had to hold a press conference to say he was alive when he got back to Boston 
[14:30]
 they knew we were screwed.  We knew it was over.  We knew we were screwed.  What was that the next day because he was still flying back from Florida.  Yeah he's got a real bad speech impediment.  I mean you make mayor Giuliani seems like a speech therapist next to this guy.  like I'm alive.  I'm very angry.  It's like Andre the giant.  Yeah.  So we were we thought we were untouchable. 
[15:00]
 We had the number one show in Boston.  By far no one was near us and we're like we can do anything.  They'll never fire us.  Yeah.  Whoops.  Oh contraire.  Yeah we want to keep this job for a while so I don't think we'll be doing anything tomorrow.  No you promised me and you've never lied to me yet.  No that's true.  We got to earn your trust before we disappoint you.  Yes we don't have your trust.  Lest we be whacked.  So there will be no April Fool's joke here.  We want to we should talk to a Lucas. 
[15:30]
 He's with CBS right.  He's the guy that fired us.  We ought to get a year later.  Yeah he fired us.  You should call him tomorrow.  Let's call him tomorrow.  I never want to see that man again.  The Terminator we call him.  I still have nightmares.  You know what it's like to get fired.  It's like man corporate firings are just amazing.  They get a guy.  This is the guy.  He came in and we never met him before.  We thought someone close to us would fire us kind of like in the mafia where someone  close waxed.  Yeah no he came in and goes paid to meet under these circumstances but good enough term nature 
[16:00]
 contract terminate terminate couldn't even say fire with extreme prejudice.  Right.  And then he had the Weasley lawyer.  Yeah he said we'll have termination contract.  Wow the extreme prejudice was from apocalypse now.  Well then he had the Weasley lawyer that was sweating and shaking.  I think he thought we were going to lose it on him or something.  Yeah he goes you guys really talented you'll get another job don't worry about it.  He was just freaking out that this was going down.  Pretty fun.  Boy it was just so much fun. 
[16:30]
 Yeah.  Then we went to the bar and the news already knew that we were fired because there's our  faces on the screen as we were getting drunk.  With the big red fired graphic over it.  That was cute.  Yeah that was great.  That's what you do after you get fired.  But no no worry no worry.  We will.  No we won't do any goof.  Yeah we'd be stupid to put our jobs in jeopardy.  We're home.  This is our hometown man.  Yeah that's it.  That Boston thing was just like a goof.  No goofy.  It wasn't that wasn't that great having to make it look like you were psyched that the 
[17:00]
 Sox won a game.  Woo go yeah.  Right.  How long were you in Boston?  Three years.  Three.  So tomorrow's the big day for us.  Our whole lives change.  It doesn't feel like a year that has it.  No no kind of kind of zipped by in some ways.  And so in other ways it seems like ten.  Ten years.  So I think I've aged ten years.  All right let's play some music.  Yeah man.  So the boss has come in and he's.  Do you want to give us the day off tomorrow. 
[17:30]
 Our listeners will be pissed though they want us here.  Yeah we got to stay here.  Let the listeners decide.  Really?  I don't know.  They want to hear you here.  Yeah really.  Yeah.  And then one time you'll hear get them off.  Get them off.  Get Muni back.  Rick's inside saying I can do the show.  I can do the show.  So tomorrow you're going to be so paranoid that you're going to be checking in on our  show just to make sure everything's going OK.  I trust you.  That might be that might be very bad judgment on my part but I do trust you guys.  Any pranks planned for wins upstairs? 
[18:00]
 They must really just lose it on April 1st right.  Because they have the facilities you know.  You know what.  Empire State Building collapsed.  Right.  Ten ten wins you know.  It's just a joke.  Everyone will believe it if something came out of wins like that.  Anything wins says they believe.  Oh yeah.  Very very careful.  Yeah that's got to be rough.  I hate when those stations change the format for a day.  Yeah all of a sudden they go.  The listeners have no idea what's going on.  Yeah.  Makes no sense.  Any of the April Fool's. 
[18:30]
 That's why we did that last year.  Because it's so stupid to do any April Fool's gag on the radio because first of all everyone  knows it's April 1st and secondly they're just stupid.  Right.  I mean they're not fun.  Look out your window at 920 this morning you'll see a meteor pass over the city.  Someone will do that one.  Right.  Oh please.  What was funny is you know what I forgot completely tomorrow is April 1st.  And we had talked about it about a week ago.  Of course.  And somebody at wins says to me before oh hey take care see you tomorrow.  Oh what will Opie and Anthony have planned for tomorrow? 
[19:00]
 Whoa!  Scott goes running for the stairs.  That's stopped by the studio before it goes.  Yeah we have a pretty bad reputation when it comes to that.  Now we'll play it straight.  That'll be fun though up at wins you know get the traffic guy.  Traffic's like totally backed up at the Midtown Tunnel and he goes traffic moving great at  the Midtown Tunnel.  And then ten minutes later April Fool's.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha.  Traffic and weather are on the ones.  That ain't going to happen. 
[19:30]
 All right so we're going to work tomorrow and we're just going to play some audio of  our big April Fool's prank from last year.  That's what we can get.  We'll be very careful boss.  Yes.  Don't worry boss we'll do good.  Mr. Herman, it's me Julianne on line one.  That's what happened up there.  The mayor called and then they were trying to stop us and at that point we're like we're  not stopping it's too late anyway.  Yeah then we started getting a bug up our ass like no screw you man. 
[20:00]
 Yeah we're not stopping.  We were young and impressionable.  Somehow Rudy doesn't seem like the kind of guy that can take a joke does he?  No.  Well I don't know Menino wasn't either obviously.  Right.  And then everybody told.  Well I was excited to go to Gumbaz of course they talk.  I was explaining yesterday.  I was explaining yesterday.  The best part about last year when we got fired they did a live shot from my front lawn.  I'm watching the news and also I'm like wait a minute.  The NBC news camera is set up in Opi's lawn. 
[20:30]
 And I'm like wait a minute and I look outside like they're doing a live shot from my lawn.  It's not following you on the other side.  No.  And then they were chasing us and then the company went.  I went out to my car just so I could do the coat over my head thing on the news because  I wanted that clip on the news.  That looked very natural.  And then we got fired the company didn't like support us at all so now we're out there alone  and then we have camera crews chasing us down the street wherever we went in the malls restaurants  it was nuts. 
[21:00]
 You haven't seen lack of support till it happens again.  Oh really.  Scott it's Anthony from the Opi and Anthony.  Oh click.  All right.  Now you needn't worry.  We're a lot more responsible.  I think we learned a lot in the past year.  Don't you open.  Your trust tomorrow boss.  You know what if we could be laughing about this April 2nd it'll be a fine Friday afternoon 
[21:30]
 around here.  Anyway yeah we're not going to be on the air tomorrow.  The Grease man is going to be on.  Just tired here at NW with me the Grease man.  Let's see who the first guest is.  Oh it's Bill Cosby.  And I'll stop right there.  The amazing thing is how long did it take the company to fire you.  On seconds.  No it took no no.  I had a whole day.  You know it took about a week.  It took a week. 
[22:00]
 That's right.  You're right.  It took three hours to find the Grease man.  Yeah.  We did do it out of the.  We got to take another break.  One of thanks God for stopping by.  He's still paranoid but we'll do good boss.  We'll do good.  Don't you worry.  I'm not going to sleep at all tonight.  We'll get through this.  Yeah.  Do you want to give us a day off.  No.  No we got we got to come in and do the do the.  If you give us a day off.  Then we're going to thank you don't you don't trust us and that's bad.  Yeah.  This is like when. 
[22:30]
 OK.  This is like when Greg Brady was supposed to deliver the drawings for his father when  he was working at the architecture firm and he lost the first set and then he had to let  him deliver another set just to prove his trust.  So you're in the Mike Brady seat right here.  No you know because I know you.  If I show you that I don't trust you tomorrow you'll screw me on April 2nd.  So it doesn't really matter.  I might as well just trust you.  You really don't have a choice.  No I might as well just trust you.  In all fairness you know you really don't have a choice.  You've got a good history.  I might as well just trust you.  Right right.  You know.  We'll do a little retrospective and maybe we'll even try to mend fences with the mayor 
[23:00]
 of Boston.  The Rock of New York 1027 W&W, Goo Goo Dolls and Dizzy the Cars Before That, it's Opiate  Anthony.  Hey.  And the headphones still crapping out Pete if you're listening.  God damn.  We're going to fix that.  I don't know why we're putting new equipment into the N.A.W. studio when the old stuff  works just fine.  Well the old equipment.  Right.  There's some other old stuff around here that doesn't work too well.  All right Anthony. 
[23:30]
 It's Whip them Out Wednesday.  We have debuted it here in New York.  Yes we have.  Want to explain it really fast in case people are just tuning in?  Well the weather is beautiful outside.  It's the first real spring like day.  Rush hour kind of sucks.  You're stuck in traffic.  You need a diversion.  We're encouraging the ladies as they drive home and they're dressed a lot lighter now.  They don't have as bulky clothes on to flash your fellow motorist. 
[24:00]
 Right.  Doesn't matter even if you want to flash another girl.  Right.  We love that too.  You're going to make someone's day.  You're going to make someone's week.  You may make someone's life.  If you're a guy driving home you look to your side when you're stuck in traffic and see  beautiful set of breasts pressed against the window or just pulled out.  You're going to talk about that for days to your friends.  It's going to be the best thing that happened to you.  So that's what Whip them Out Wednesday is about.  We're encouraging the women to whip them out.  Once again trying to take care of our faithful listeners and make their ride home just a  little easier.  Yes. 
[24:30]
 That's what it's about.  And as a little encouragement on the guys cars you might want to put a wow somewhere  on your car.  window or something bumper sticker whatever you want to do and that'll show that you're  an active participant.  Right.  So if a girl's looking around the highway who should I flash she sees a wow.  Yeah.  You're the target.  You're the man.  That's who she's going to flash.  And Anthony believe it or not like clockwork I think we got our first flasher on the line.  Well this didn't take long.  Hi.  Hi.  Who's this?  This is Trisha.  What's going on Trisha? 
[25:00]
 Not much.  Where are you calling from?  Clifton New Jersey.  All right.  You got any news for us.  I just participated in wow on my way home.  You did.  Yeah.  There you go.  About five minutes after you announced it I was on forty six and I just whipped them out.  Now you got to give us the details.  Did a guy check it out?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you know it was really convenient because I thought on my way home from work and I had  taken off my bra because it was uncomfortable so we got the full view.  Now what did his face look like when he saw?  He was a little shocked I think.  He was middle aged and you know what the young girl flashed it for on forty six but he liked 
[25:30]
 it.  You just made that guy's life.  He will go home now and tell everybody he was just on his way home and this girl flashed  me.  The happiest man in the world now.  Yeah well I do it a lot actually.  It's kind of like my community service.  I help people out.  You must have real nice breasts.  I do.  I do.  So I've heard.  Well that's it.  The first boobs have been thrown out for Whip them Out Wednesday.  I think we've got to give you a prize for that.  You think? 
[26:00]
 I think so.  All right.  Hold on the line.  All right.  Yeah.  It has begun Anthony.  This is it.  This is what it's all about.  It's about beautiful weather, beautiful breasts and people who just want something a little  better in life than their lousy commute home.  Now they have this to look forward to.  And this is on a volunteer basis.  We're not forcing the ladies to do it.  We don't want the guys to harass anyone.  If it's going to happen it's going to happen.  Of course. 
[26:30]
 And it's happening.  This just.  It is one of the best things for people.  I think we're promoting peace on earth.  Of course.  It makes people happy.  And we're encouraging the ladies to call in if they're participating today.  You think my road rage would be as bad if I looked over when we're driving and just  saw boobs?  You'd be the happiest.  Of course.  Screw road rage.  Who cares about the point?  Cabbie in front of me at that point.  Right.  Yeah.  All right Anthony.  Priceline.com.  Priceline. 
[27:00]
 hotel rooms mortgages now.  Yes.  And this company is doing something right because their IPO hit the market what two  days ago.  Yeah.  The IPO is what 19 dollars a share.  You could get in at 16 a share.  16 a share if you knew someone at Priceline.  And the stock went up to 89 in one day.  Went up yeah into the 80s and closed out at 69 bucks.  So obviously these guys are on to something.  They're going to be big.  Really big.  It's like Bill Shatner said.  Look at the picture of William Shatner. 
[27:30]
 Priceline blasts off.  Online ticketing enterprise IPO up 331 percent.  Bid me up.  Now they have all these like William Shatner things.  Priceline's IPO boldly went where few offerings have gone before.  And then William Shatner's picture in the post.  It looks like his toupee isn't on strike.  Let me see.  Look.  Oh it looks like it's pushed back too far.  Poor guy.  What happened?  I must have stepped on the accelerator too hard on my way to the photo shoot.  All right so here's the deal. 
[28:00]
 If you need airline tickets, hotel rooms or even home mortgages you go on the Priceline.com  website www.Priceline.com and you tell them how much you want to pay for that hotel room  or that airline ticket.  Why pay full price?  And they'll get back to you and say well this is what we can do for you.  Guaranteed to save something.  Of course.  You go to a nice hotel and you knock on your neighbor's door.  How much did you pay?  And they'll say five hundred bucks. 
[28:30]
 You know what?  I paid three.  Because that's what I wanted to pay for my stay here.  There you go.  Hey Mark.  Yeah.  You're on the Garden State Parkway.  Yeah I still got her too.  I just passed my exit.  I said to hell with it.  I'll just keep going.  I still got her.  You got a lady next to you.  She's right next to me right now.  It's hysterical because I'm like she sees me talking to you guys and she thinks it's  going to come on the radio any minute.  But I told her.  I said you got to listen to 127.  She goes and she keeps making a sign in her hand like I don't know if I'm going to do 
[29:00]
 it.  I'm like if you guys get on the radio and start intimidating her maybe she will.  Well we don't want to intimidate her.  We want to encourage her.  Yeah the word is encourage.  We are encouraging the ladies to flash their fellow commuters today for Whip-A-Mail Wednesday.  Right, right.  Look at Ralph laughing over there.  It's a beautiful day.  The girls are dressed a lot lighter than they usually are and it's easier to expose yourselves  to your fellow drivers.  I think we never cease to amaze Ralph.  I love it.  I love it.  Oh this is. 
[29:30]
 Whip it out Wednesday.  Whip-A-Mail Wednesday.  The Rock of New York 1027W, NWU2 and the sweetest thing David Bowie before that.  It's opiate Anthony just in a great mood today.  It is obvious that spring has finally sprung and we have decided to break out Whip-A-Mail  Wednesday down here in New York.  We're feeling it.  We're feeling it.  Trust me this thing works.  This promotion.  It makes the ride home easier.  You know the people love you.  You hear it in their voice when they're calling in. 
[30:00]
 They're happy.  You think there's road rage going on when a guy is whooping it up that he just saw a  boobs.  Oh you forget about the ride home.  Of course.  You forget about everything when you see a foreign boo.  Especially when you're not expecting it.  Then you just want to tell your friends that you saw this.  Correct.  You know that's the way it works.  Opiate Anthony just trying to make your ride home a little easier.  You want to wow girls.  Feel free guys.  You want to be wowed.  You want to see some of these just slip a little wow on your car somewhere.  Yeah ladies. 
[30:30]
 Works.  Ladies right now if you hear our voice celebrate spring and whip them out to your fellow commuter.  You know how the Robin Red breast flies in on springtime.  Oh yeah.  We're looking for the female bear breast and someone is this through the fax machine.  Scott Colombo the computer geek here.  We love Scott.  We just like calling him the computer geek.  He just came up with a wow sign with our baby faces and the any W logo.  That's pretty funny.  We should have about ten thousand of these and hand them out at our next promotion. 
[31:00]
 I don't get to wowed.  That's good man.  All right.  I mean we want to move on with other things today but we are trying to kick this promotion  off right.  Yeah.  And we just got the phones packed with people that are seeing stuff.  Adam.  Yo.  What's going on?  What's happening guys?  How are you?  I'm having some experiences where you kind of go like yeah.  I was driving down the road and I was listening to you guys and I stopped at the convenience  store to get something to drink so I had a masking tape in my car.  So I threw it up there and I'm driving down the road and we're stopped at a stop sign 
[31:30]
 and there was this Honda Civic I looked over and it was a case of gorgeous girl with fat  friend and they both got wind of wow and the gorgeous girl was driving and I looked over  flash at the same time so I look over and I'm like yeah.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Come on it was still cool.  Absolutely.  All right.  Absolutely. 
[32:00]
 They got to take the good with the bad.  There you have it man.  I guess I'll just have to train my eyes for the rest of the summer to just focus on the  thinner boobs.  All right buddy thank you.  Guys you rock.  Cool.  All right have a good one.  Bye.  Bye.  You can just hear it in the guys faces.  Not faces.  They are so happy.  That's what it's all about.  Nice weather.  It's perfect for wow.  The wow boob index today.  I'd say an eight.  Yeah I just felt so much happier driving into work today. 
[32:30]
 You can just feel it in the air.  It's here.  It's upon us.  We got to celebrate.  Love it.  And ladies if you're in your car right now and you're feeling a little scared a little  worried and you got a cell phone call us up and we will walk you through the whip them  out Wednesday process for you.  Do you like doing that early in the wow promotion.  Girls call up.  Yeah we talk in.  You know like the old airport movies where the pilot dies and the stewardess has to get  up.  We'll talk in.  We'll talk in. 
[33:00]
 All right keep your nose up.  Keep your nips up.  Keep your nips up.  Great prank.  Sounds real.  It's open Anthony.  What?  What?  I thought it sounded great.  I thought that was just as good as the jerky boys and I just want to give the guy credit  for that great prank call.  All right.  No what.  So we're all just having fun here.  I just wanted you know so give credit where credit's due.  What do you got.  Well it's whipping out Wednesday and people are just losing their their crap right now.  All right. 
[33:30]
 Facts is coming in like crazy.  Whip them out Wednesday.  You guys are the greatest.  What a concept.  Why didn't anyone come up with this sooner.  I've been driving a tractor trailer on the Long Island Expressway for 13 years and have  never been flashed intentionally.  If this works out I owe you guys.  Right from Long Island.  Let me tell you the truckers.  What works the best is the big barn doors in the back of your rig.  You put a W.O.W. in the dirt.  Right in the dirt where kids will write wash me and stuff.  And we have found through experience with Whip Mouth Wednesday that the girls pull up 
[34:00]
 on side of the rig.  Give you a quick flash.  Exactly.  It's amazing.  And you truckers out there that listen to us get on those damn CBs of yours and spread  the word for us.  Yeah.  All right.  It's wow written in the dirt on the back of your rig.  Merry Mint on the way home.  Joy.  This is great.  We had truckers when we did this at another station where they write wow on the back of  their truck really big and then they have an arrow that kind of points to the left side. 
[34:30]
 Yeah.  To drive around.  So drive around.  Flash me in and get on your way.  Also the construction sites were big.  They were starting to put up wow flags and bigger the cement road barricades.  They used that fluorescent yellow paint that they marked the road with big wows on that.  We would just found wow everywhere.  Everywhere.  Well this is just the beginning.  We have just begun the promotion.  It's our latest demented idea.  Yes.  If this works we're even going to fade out the Tuesday night Hummer Club and bring that  back in the fall because a bunch of ladies are bitching saying wait another club or idea 
[35:00]
 for guys only.  Well this is the summertime one.  You know.  Don't worry girls.  What do you want?  ballbag Thursday or something and a bunch of ladies right now in their car going yeah exactly  that's what I want.  It's hard to get out of your seat while you're driving.  Alex what do you have?  Alex.  I don't know.  Our phones are crap enough.  Are they?  We got we got to get the equipment working in here.  It would really be nice.  Alex Alex. 
[35:30]
 Is that terrible.  How how how can we how can we run the command center here.  None of the equipment works.  See I don't understand.  I don't think the management understands that we really need to communicate with our listeners  on a daily basis.  That means the phones have to work perfect every day starting at three.  If you're just spinning tunes someone points at you and you go double do any double do.  That's one thing.  Right.  If you're taking calls from people and they want to be interactive with your audience  this stuff has got to work right. 
[36:00]
 Let's see if it works.  Hi.  A W.  Hey.  All right there is Alex.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm going to tell you a story.  I'm driving in my suburban going to pick up my wife from work.  I put the sign on the back of my window.  Yeah.  I pick her up.  I forget to take the sign off.  She don't like to drive with the radio on because she gets a headache.  We're driving down four people four girls flash me.  My wife is like why is everybody keep flashing you.  I love you guys. 
[36:30]
 You guys are going to get me divorced.  Well you put the sign up.  I know.  I forgot to take it off.  All right.  Cool man.  Thanks Alex.  All right.  All right.  The sign does help.  Yes.  Now we need to hear from a few ladies.  Yeah.  One oh two seven W.N.E.W.  The Rock of New York.  Black Crow is only a fool from by your side.  You're hanging with Hopi and Anthony.  Lots and lots happening today.  Thanks for joining us. 
[37:00]
 We appreciate it.  Phone's going nuts right now.  It's lovely.  Lovely Wednesday.  Yes it's a beautiful beautiful day.  Oh we got the Pat St. John thing.  In here.

He still gets calls here from BMW dealers. 
[37:30]
 You should see what's going on.  What's going on.  He must have made a lot of cash here.  I guess so.  We got screwed because he's got BMW dealerships and what not calling them.  They had some massive contracts I guess.  Well also our fax machine in the office has an answering machine on it.  It clicked in the other day while we were in the office.  You know what it is.  No it's Pat.  Well doing the message.  Well Rick's got it here for us to check out.

I guess somebody should have told us about that.  We didn't know. 
[38:30]
 No we had no idea.  So we apologize if you're still getting that.  We read in the paper today what movie phone has Scott so doing an NW report or something.  Yeah in the daily news in David Hinckley's column I guess it was a slow radio day.  I guess so.  Yeah.  Number one radio market in the country and he has nothing to write about in his column.  Yeah classic rock lives.  If you call movie phone 777 film and press the button for what's happening at 1027 FM 
[39:00]
 you'll hear the voice of Scott Muny telling you all about the classic rock and classic  jocks at WNEW.  P for it tells there too on the air of course all of the above are long gone.  The really surprising part is that current any WFM guys.  Hopey and Anthony haven't made a bit out of this yet.  Look at David Hinckley giving us big ideas in the paper helping us out.  Hey thanks.  Thanks Dave.  We would have never thought about that.  That works.  Well you want to call the we could call them.

That guy lost his hair at some point in his life. 
[40:00]
 Yeah he had a natural hairline he had a pulled back.  He didn't have like that doll's head hair look.  It looked like you wouldn't know he had any kind of anything on his head except natural  growing hair.  We were absolutely amazed and then he went on to tell us that he could go outside in  the rain.  He goes swimming he could play sports and sweat.  It just doesn't matter to this guy.  He was pulling on it.  Yeah he was like dude you're going to pull it off.  He goes no not at all.  Look and he was pulling my wow.  I was amazed.  We saw the before pictures and without a doubt this guy had no hair. 
[40:30]

Our listeners are stuck in traffic one guy.  He put a W.O.W. wow whip them out Wednesday on his car.  He went out got flashed.  He was so happy on the phone.  He said I gotta go.  I'm going back out.  He was done with his commute but he was going back out because he had been flashed and he 
[42:30]
 thought it was amazing.  I mean it's obvious spring is finally upon us.  Yeah we're celebrating that fact today so we decide today is the perfect day to break  this out.  Whip them out Wednesday.  When we did this at a other radio station it was absolutely huge.  It takes off it gets a life of its own.  Yeah we'll be doing this every Wednesday until the bosses say no.  Throughout the summer.  As the weeks go it just builds and builds and builds.  Yeah you want to put a little thing in your back window.  Wow truckers the big barn doors on the back of your truck just in the dirt.

You're wowing people?  Yeah I did.  I just turned it on.  I was waiting all week to hear what you guys were planning for today.  I finally heard and I was like all right you know let's do it.  And I wowed a jogger and I wowed an old man in his Buick and he was having an accident.  Yeah you guys got to watch out while you're driving. 
[45:30]
 Be careful.  Better in slow traffic I think.  Yeah well Spice got the nicest wows man.  You're the hardcore champion you know.  Yeah?  We gave you the title of hardcore champion for the Opie and Anthony show.  Well if you can find hardcore than me I'd be happy to challenge her.  Hey what kind of clients you got tonight?  Something a little bit interesting.  We're doing a little bit of dressing up tonight.  A little dress up?  Yeah.  For those of you following along at home that don't know, Spike is a dominatrix. 
[46:00]
 Just filling people in.  We're not dressing up like a lady though.  We're dressing up like a baby.  Oh it's a baby.  Are you serious?  And that's a client thank you to you guys.  Oh really?  That's one of our sick listeners they got a hold of you?  Absolutely.  And what's the fantasy?  He wants to be just a baby in diapers and stuff.  Baby in diapers and taken care of and I'm more than happy to do it so I get to be a  mommy tonight.  Do you spank him if he's bad?  No he's never bad.  Oh so he doesn't go in his diaper or anything? 
[46:30]
 Well alright that's a little bit bad but you got to forgive the baby.  Baby do that.  You're going to deal with this tonight?  Absolutely.  Do you get nervous?  No I don't think we're going to allow that.  No?  It's a first section so we're going to take it a little bit easier.  So what does he do?  He does baby talk and waddles around and you go like good baby, good boy.  Exactly.  I get to do baby talk and I haven't even had a baby yet.  This guy, he's a listener of our show.  Yeah I know he's probably listening now going I'll curse her if she does my name on the 
[47:00]
 air.  Is that a blast and he just goes like gookaboo.  Yeah pretty much.  Is he going to wear a bib and stuff?  If I make him yeah.  And this is the sexual turn on for him?  Yes absolutely.  And there's going to be no spanking or anything like that?  No it's just nice cuddling.  So he cuddled like a mommy and then.  How many guys do you know that wouldn't like to be cuddled by me?  Yeah but wear a diaper. 
[47:30]
 Wear a little diaper.  If I said to you come on you little female dog wear a diaper and I'm going to cuddle  you you'd be like okay just cuddle me.  I wouldn't do the baby diaper thing.  Liar liar liar.  No no no I'd be like Spike what are you out of your frigging mind?  Yeah Spike I'm a little twisted but no way I would not do that.  Are you going to change his diaper if he messes?  Absolutely.  With rubber gloves on of course.  Come on you know he's going to want that.  Oh my god.  Can you imagine the scene this big hairy legs coming out of a diaper. 
[48:00]
 It has a five o'clock shadow.  No he shaved for me.  He better shave for me or he's going to get spanked.  Oh what like you mean all over?  No but shave the face at least to make him look like a baby.  Oh I'm sure that'll work.  Big dorky guy going around in a baby outfit.  Are you going to feed him like baby food and stuff?  I'm thinking about it.  I'm thinking about it.  How long does the session last?  About an hour.  About an hour so he gets in his attire and then what you sit on a couch or something 
[48:30]
 and he snuggles up next to you and goes kooka do boop boop boop.  No we put him on the bed with pillows around him so he doesn't fall off.  And we kind of pet his head and tell him he's a good baby.  God that is funny.  I think it's wonderful that you guys get to kick out one of people's enjoyment.  It's so funny.  It's great.  You've got to call us with all your sessions, the interesting ones.  Oh I will most definitely.  Are you in the car right now? 
[49:00]
 Yes I am.  Do you want to wow someone live on our show or what?  I've got to find someone.  I'm parked.  Oh you're parked?  Where are you?  About.  It's my house so maybe it's not a good idea to wow someone in front of my house.  That would not be cool.  That's funny like could you picture her leaning over the crib?  It would be like those mobiles.  You ever see the mobiles that the kids play with?  But only it would be your boobs.  You do the other thing.  Yeah they can go like Google, Google, Google and play with them.  I will definitely keep you guys updated if I come up with anything else fun. 
[49:30]
 Is this the sickest one you've had lately?  Oh no.  Well the TV exec from two weeks ago that likes to dress as a girl.  A little girl.  That was pretty cool.  Yes that was definitely fun.  I have another one of those next weekend.  Different guy?  A business owner.  What beats the guy dressing up like a baby?  Things I can't really say on the air maybe.  Oh really?  That good?  Nothing illegal just strange. 
[50:00]
 Can you talk like in code or something?  What's the problem?  You just don't want to admit that.  The last time she said like water sports.  Oh right.  Things like that.  Right well that's always a little bit on the eccentric side.  Did you ever do the foot worship and there are certain people that like strange things  done.  Did you ever do the thing where the guy lays underneath the table?  The glass table?  The glass table?  No.  I've seen videos of that.  Sylvester Stallone is supposed to like that.  That was in a book.  You'd be amazed what famous people like. 
[50:30]
 I could be a video editor but you know that I wouldn't have a job anymore.  Yo Adrian, why don't you squat over this table here.  I'm going to lay underneath here.  Crap on the table!  Crap on the table Adrian!  Mickey, Mickey, grab on the table Mickey.  Hey Paulie, come here.  Crap on the table!  I'm going to go get dressed and prepared to be a mommy.  I'll give you guys a call when I find out something else good. 
[51:00]
 Well Spike thanks for participating in Whip-a-Mow Wednesday.  Always, every Wednesday.  Alright Spike.  Take care.  You're the man.  Bye.  Bye.  Apollo, I want you to crap on this table!  It was in a book and Sylvester Stallone never sued and the deal is he likes to just kind  of lay under a glass table and have the ladies.  Rock your crap you're a dead rock! 
[51:30]
 Crap on me Mickey!  Crap on me Mickey!  That's a sick fantasy.  I pity the poor fool I crap on.  Oh man.  Well the fuck.  Crap you're a dead rock!  A lot of people getting flashed today Anthony.  Whip-a-Mow Wednesday has started off on the right foot today.  Samantha, New Jersey on the incident feedback. 
[52:00]
 Well I was driving through Ramsey, New Jersey and I saw this cute guy driving this green  and white motorcycle so I flashed him and he jerked back looking through his rear view  mirror looked around to see if anyone saw me do this and then drove away.  Great idea guys, thanks.  Yeah, there we go.  So we're getting sightings all over the place.  This guy wants to get in touch with Spike.  Really?  Right, so how do I get in touch with Spike?  Well we're going to have to hook him up.  What's her email address again?  Mistress 47.  Mistress 47?

He held up like he had this big glass plate it was like a serving tray.  Alright.  Clear glass.  He was laid down on the floor.  Alright we know what happens with the girl.  Are you and he was into that?  Oh he loved it.  What is the other word for it?  Is it a Coney Island steamer?  No.  I think it is something like that.  The only other one I can think of is like Coney Island whitefish but we know what that is.

 She's looking at me so I whip it out and show it to her.  No it's not that way.  Oh well she came over gave me a ticket for a decent exposure.  Why it was a cop?  Yeah!  I'm the top of the female cop man.  You can't do that.  Well thank you.  Well who's going to pay the fine?  You just gave me a seventy five dollar sum.  We said that the ladies have to whip out their breasts.  That's why it doesn't work the other way.  We realize one way it's fun and the other way it's a crime.  Yeah one way it's legal and the other way it's illegal. 
[55:00]
 Yeah well obviously I just found that illegal.  Seventy five dollar summons my friend.  It was worth it though right?  You know the expression on her face was great.  You know.  For a second or two.  And then sure as you know here comes the ticket book.  Oh man.  Right on man.  Keep it in your pants.  You guys are great.  Hey thanks.  Alright have a good one.  Bye.  Bye.

And you looked over and what happened? 
[57:00]
 I looked over and it was a nice looking brand new Volvo.  This woman had empty plates on her car and I got flesh.  Did it make your ride home?  I'm going to work.  Maybe my ride work will help much better.  Yeah you sound a little happier.  Thanks guys.  Alright man.  Later.  Well it's working.  It's happening.  It seems to be working.

What road do you want?  I'm on the 287 right now.  Have you flashed anyone?  No I haven't because I'm driving.  I can't do it at the same time.  Well if you're careful you can.  You want to do it live on the radio right now?  I can't.  I can't do it.  I'm a real fader you know.  Well what do you need?  Do you need someone to drive you around so you can do it? 
[58:00]
 Exactly and then I would do it all over town.  And you have no problem doing this right?  No problem.  Right on.  There you go.  Just put on a pair of sunglasses and I'll be fine.  Oh cool.  Alright.  Well have a great ride home.  This is beautiful.  Alright.  Bye bye.  So far the ladies like this.  Yes.  Hi NW.  Hi.

[58:30]
 Well is anyone looking at you?  No.  Well beep your horn.  Where do we go?  Hi.  Now give a flash.  Well it's kind of hard when you're driving though.  That's the only thing.  Well you're in traffic though right?  Yeah it's kind of slow.  You can pull one out.  Pull one out.  We don't want to cause an accident though.  Well be careful.  Okay.  Honk honk again.  Alright is someone looking at you? 
[59:00]
 No.  What if I was in trouble?  Nobody is even looking at all.  The guy right next to you has no idea what he can see if he looks over.  No he's pretty old too.  I think I might be scaring him actually.  You guys are great.  I love you.  Well thank you.  Thanks.  Bye.
