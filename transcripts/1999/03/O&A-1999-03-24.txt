[00:30]
 suggested some of the ladies calling with their wet dreams if they have a  i don't know if it's the same thing  i don't know is is is there a female equivalent  i'm not a female you're not a female may learn something new here is there a an  orgasmic finish to uh... girls version of the wet dream  well if the ladies brave enough to call in the uh... maybe we can find that out  if any i would like to also we gotta thank the faithful listeners for sending  us the cate moss pictures  yeah we finally a problem up and uh... who 
[01:00]
 they have big story the paper day i cate moss is careers in a lot of trouble uh...  who is she with calin kline or whatever  yeah was a calcine  temple clined  dropped her and uh... she's trying to jumpstart career self  uh... for british vote i think  and she did a six-page spread naked photos  and instead of everyone talking about how hot she is and stuff uh... the word  is that everyone's being fun of her inverted nipple  all right and we got the pictures here and that's uh... that's a bizarre nipple  right there anthony 
[01:30]
 i'm i'm looking uh...  you know she's she has one normal one  and one inverted it looks like  to me it looks like a flat tire  i think a little flat tire  yeah  so it's not it's not working  the other nip looks a little weird to know about a bunch of guys have called  said that they really did the inverted nipple look  and really  and i just makes it look like a big gravy state of starry uh... 
[02:00]
 but at the time in the peace  yeah it's just whatever  i don't know  all right she was had for about five minutes  also getting a lot of requests of people want to hear the hillary and chelsea bit  from yesterday  other little trip but africa you want me to want to blow it out here  yeah we played a pretty late yesterday all right kevin's finding it  this to him kev  yeah very uh... interesting we've got audio 
[02:30]
 of hillary and chelsea  in africa they went over there on  to get i guess is far away from bill clinton as is humanly possible  so they had to go to another continent  and uh... we have audio  of their adventures  india african jungle  we might not have a lot of why why where is it  oh come on it's gotta be over there  you got him  uh... yeah the uh...  bill clinton's ready to commit forces uh... if if they're not already 
[03:00]
 to war  in cause of all  and she's off uh...  galavanting around the globe right  and that's nice you know don't stay at the white house and you know support  uh...  troops and everybody else you know  congala pants but we have philis who had a wet dream  although we are going to go to the falls off i wanted to hear that  what this yeah  honestly some people are saying this is the the funniest thing we have done well  so if you didn't hear this uh... yesterday stick around we'll get on very  soon but i think uh... we got to see what fills is all right i want to hear 
[03:30]
 this  a little note uh... the management of any w four to start taking more phone  calls on our show  we need the buttons like right in front of us  because this is what happens every day okay let's talk to philis on the way  over here now  you need like a phone bank thing over there and also is the nice to have a  screen where it says like philis line one was a talk about wet dreams instead  of like rick running back and forth like a madman from another room pencil  scrap  well maybe the computer that now has the music that's being played 
[04:00]
 maybe that could be used for the phone calls that can be uh... transfer you  know once uh... you know things happen or don't i don't know  well i'd be a nice screen that would make a lot of show the right there the  phone calls i'm sure you can rewire it  doesn't have to show the music and said it is shown the list of tunes you play  this far yeah  i'd those we got and i was driving the car going home and i had to talk to you  just on the radio on  you're talking about it possible  for women to have what you're in the same  yet  uh... it is  now i think i had to want to come in a call for some of the shot if i can get 
[04:30]
 through okay uh... well first of all uh... when you have these wet dreams uh...  does go to completion  one time it did they usually wouldn't because  the manuals to me like that's what i was wondering i i i think i myself  uh...  well i don't know if you don't say anything we had a couple of the show  you can say that were if you can say i i think you can say i you know you woke up  and said i can't believe i just completed completed the mission related 
[05:00]
 to know  i say i had the uh... the wet dream to completion  completion and uh... what was what was the dream about now be very careful in  your description of the dream and i  uh... who was uh... the idea or girl  it was  okay with that somebody that you knew or did i know yet on the work with  uh... yet  uh... man of your job you married  yet  uh... 
[05:30]
 have you been fantasizing about this guy i'd  well you know you can't talk about a lot of different people  i'm trying to find  somebody appeared in your dream i oh my god what did that person come from  you don't expect to have a fantasy about  uh...  they can't control your dreams so it's like a big jim slay  the  uh...  eight times doesn't matter what you do  uh... right  now tell you what the one that i know you heard almost a motion of the ocean 
[06:00]
 and have what you need  all right well to the support that i think something wrong on the other side  but explain you know how this dream came about  actually  i'm going to be back  all right what happened i was just a little bit  went to completion all right now but what's the setup all of a sudden you  fell asleep in your uh... you know i only remember the good part  uh... but i think that's what i was actually just  sick policy  just uh... 
[06:30]
 doing something with someone just uh...  i think it was  uh...  i wasn't anything about it or anything like that  i think we forgot about the difference between men and women and i'll be like  yes it was one of those things and guys like so i take my  and i don't think that what i believe close your eyes it really doesn't matter  all right  well we're hoping to hear that you're hanging from a swing you know something  all of us something that i think that she can maybe right but it doesn't happen 
[07:00]
 okay i think that's all right thank you you're right  hoping she had some uh...  ability to uh... relate a story with some detail i would have been nice  eroticism by the one thing a break and i would have been the chelsea hillary  thing on all right let's do that  with that way  we're running late is a very late then we can just like a man of commercials and  go right into this bit  or if we have to work  play songs but what which ones open 
[07:30]
 which gems do we not want to get the  and there is back today is going to be a person and uh...  times cuts  uh... well uh...  no we are running late so i can tell what will do is will i will come out of  spots  and we're going to get right into this that shall see in hillary bit  if you didn't hear yesterday trust me stick around it's uh... it's pretty  wacky okay alright stay right there it's only a few minutes that  well i don't know 
[08:00]

[08:30]
 name your own price  priceline comes back  and gives you the price you want within an hour now just think in priceline dot  com there is a hotel rooms and enter into airline tickets  and they're into home mortgages  home mortgage yes  that's right when they're going to get into hawkers  that  that's a good  carers  i don't know i don't know about that  it's so damn expensive and  so you're saying that it would be good if priceline you could call them with 
[09:00]
 the hooker you want to go to a correct  and instead of you know fifty bucks right  for uh... some uh... treats for some loving for some loving for some favors  yeah  you go i want to pay thirty five  and priceline comes back  with the same marker you know thirty five bucks same favors there you go  dare to dream hoping dare to dream  and you are the hardest kind of things in the air  jimmy this  got to be the stack  well i don't think they're even looking into that as we speak 
[09:30]
 but i do know about their uh... hotel rooms and i don't know and home mortgages  anthony right that's right you name your own price  priceline comes back with the price you want not the price  that the hotel wants you to pay or the  the airline wants you to honestly we're hearing uh... back from a lot of our  faithful listeners that have used the service they're going guys this really  works i've saved a lot of money why would you do this is uh... the services  free of charge  and uh... it's easy it's quick 
[10:00]
 and it's there so you know is it right my god people  but i mean your own price for crank  all the i wouldn't get into that either no okay  but they do a great job with the airline takes the hotel rooms and mortgages  right there there to serve you  but i were back in soviet and thanks for sticking with us there uh...  tencent faxes into that's cool to one two nine five seven w any w here's one  from barbara  can get on the phone but you leave any info whatsoever maybe she did maybe we  could call this little number at the time to go home all on

[11:00]
 one bummer was that i can get back to sleep small price to pay  he doing what you're doing barbara  all of our best if we get online  we got here more about that right  i would promise the chelsea hillary that  uh... all man and i think this we have to play this one first and i was like we  got two episodes here  okay here they were recently uh...  they still are in africa right now they're in north africa  uh... well they weren't the jimson's as well okay but this very little weeks in

[14:00]
 uh...  uh... that's a good thing  uh... backslide two one two nine five seven w a w you get a uh... hold of us  through the phone lines or you can use the incident uh... feedback if you're  online right now  just go to the w a w website click on our pictures and there's a an area there  we can send an email to us right here in the studio we read it uh... you know  immediately  would have been a  skater  issue constantly  constantly yelling at me about these  at me dreams and i'm constantly happy so they're always saying it in the middle 
[14:30]
 of the night my sleep i wake her up with a mom rub it up against her  i don't remember i wake up in the morning  no memory whatsoever i wake up with words but no memory of the dream at all  uh...  i don't know what to tell you guys fact  no don't remember the dreams  has no clue what's going on in them  all i know that wake up in the morning on the dog house my girlfriend  the fact that i hear at the laughing back there i know that left and i think  you got on the radio show  and you really want that on the air to try to get in trouble 
[15:00]
 for even telling us right now  now that you get put on the air again told that that book it  will keep listening to private them the idea of the u l k you would be really  if you don't put me on the air you guys just do too funny  i think i think it is a good thing  uh... as well as you say some stupid  we didn't know that we tried  i'm more stupidly on the way  the right to be a good one is a seven w a w  time that is late is free girl now from echo that's in stores and not the loop  of for that 
[15:30]
 soviet anthony  uh... this just in the entire arm cast of what's happening just got arrested  down at uh...  police headquarters  come on that's not true well i looked on the dot and i looked on the t v and  that's what it looks like to me where your police headquarters  and i think that the what's happening arrested  duane's comment was  hey hey hey  and rerun didn't dance well every day you know there's people getting arrested 
[16:00]
 uh...  and i don't know if you was going to get arrested  that  d  uh... that seems to be a good time  good move way to get some publicity way to get your face in the in the in the  press again obviously there are people who are sincere about the cause that  want to go down there and not be arrested but i think it's starting to get  to be where some people are getting down there  you know other people in entertainment get desperate  they want to go down and uh... perk their career up well webster is trying 
[16:30]
 to get arrested every day but no one can see them  uh...  but uh... i'm keeping track of all the arrests it looks like  everyone that has ever appeared in a spiky movie has been arrested anthony  how really the entire arm cast of the jefferson's good times and now today  what's happening all arrested  uh...  all arrested  and uh... the cast of different strokes already got time served  i think they didn't have to go down there but they get credit for it and i  don't know i mean does anyone else see how stupid these arrests are 
[17:00]
 i mean it's a heavy subject i don't even want to get into it i got my own  opinions about it  but i think the uh... how people are going about it and getting arrested it's  just stupid  well so it was stupid  that seems to be uh... what the people are doing well let me explain cuz that's  just throwing out like to do it uh... all right it's corey on it's choreographed  every day yeah big as a reverend al sharpton stands there any lines that  people up  right now  it's almost like they're on a red carpet outside the oscars or something that's 
[17:30]
 way for joan rivers task what they're wearing and stuff is going to turn into  that like is going to be paparazzi with the red carpet and people waving you  know  hey spike  spider  and they turn around getting arrested just all choreographed if you see it on  the news at all they're all lining up in the narrow river now gives this the  sign and they they they get arrested  and we brought up by this point i think last week on the show  if you're going to get arrested for your cause yeah get arrested some good spend 
[18:00]
 some time right to something sick i don't think they see sell time they go  in with the plastic handcuffs on the new and they fill out some paperwork  and then they're there get out there release five minutes later pretty much  i'm not getting the plunger in the case to know i mean i don't i think we should  go down there with some of these  we go down with the news is in really get arrested weapons charge and then we  get arrested a throws in rikers is something like what i thought we just  get arrested like everyone else you know what happened why do i get my own  handcuffs in the shackles right i saw on tv how i was just getting arrested a 
[18:30]
 few guys on the protest what what is it everyone else coming down here with  loaded weapons and stuff  but the but you know  i hear you don't feel at we call them plus arrests yeah  so that is the but the plastic handcuffs on your in the precinct for five minutes  and they let you go and then who  all your pictures all over the paper you're just radical you're just out of  control it kind of takes away from the arrest i mean the old days  of uh... civil disobedience  back in the sixties  when they got arrested  they got arrested running that was it 
[19:00]
 you were getting locked up you probably spend at least a night in there  in the real jail  and not you know this ceremonial  i have been arrested right  you know when you just got let in to putting a revolving arrest or yeah and  the new york police headquarters  we go in one side you revolve out the other  technically been arrested yeah  but i think the cops down there must be just looking at this like this is such a  deal i got my god to be out uh... fighting crime into another stuff for  society and we have to sit here to arrest people 
[19:30]
 you know yeah heavy cause and i i understand that but if if you really  believe in this cause  would go down there openly self-crack  in front of police headquarters so let's see uh... people that are out in a blaze  of glory  people that are going down there that really mean uh... that the they are  sincere about the cause that they believe in or people just trying to get  publicity  all right somebody like uh... as he davis  who is down there  uh... do you think he was for for the cause 
[20:00]
 uh... yeah he's yet he's a pretty heavy did pretty heavy duty now unity now what  about i saw venus flytrap from wk rp in cincinnati down there well i would have  to  i think maybe he's doing for the publicity and i would think uh...  definitely publicity okay  all right how about obviously the reverend al down there every day he's  got his uh... his he's got his cause he's that now you see someone like isaac  from the love boat as you can there are both are reaching the cause i can't  i think he's there to boost his career you may be right on that one anthony 
[20:30]
 how about um...  how about walona from good times and walona from good times uh...  yeah i think she's uh... look at some publicity as well publicity definitely  what if i like they say bill cosby might show up that that's a tough one i think  you know if you look at it well he's got his career on t v uh... going and uh...  and that's what's just making this all  just a joke at this point it's in the paper bill cosby and over winfrey  uh... are thinking about getting arrested arrested along with mayor 
[21:00]
 kach  who  while  it like the cause is gonna spend some hard time in reichers or somewhere else  that uh...  going down for the time  the house with the time you see  we had to be a  are going to what i like to call jello  uh...  or going to believe that board  the good to go with the plastic and doesn't go with the jail or  is not a real jail  is jello is solved in three and they are all 
[21:30]
 lol  the cause  is there  for the cause you know and i have a good cause and i think it will be here at  south is that he's gonna get arrested it'll be all over the papers all over  america  and then one of the and it's one of the other one of these puss around on the  cause wants to become a jailhouse bitch  yet for the cause  you see i want to go to russia's and be there  queen of the weight room problem using 
[22:00]
 laying in the mail of the second if you really believe in this cause once you go  down there and do some pimpin  now i'm using them  number i used to look on our spot  and then the cover goes the pampered the big happen before i go to them  gone and jello  i'm going to toss in some salad and jello because they're not all is  pimpin a t-shirt  and then i mean  when you have a car  and then jello  so the cause i would say is there for the cause 
[22:30]
 yeah of course there for the cause now what if you see freddie boom boom  washington down on his knees he needs to publicity  have you seen his ridiculous commercial you see that the golf on a tangent but  what happened to boom boom washington i saw this commercial it's uh... he's  singing who's that lady who's that  for two so i'm not even a split second is on the screen there in the background  of like  friday boom boom washington  look at friday boom boom washington so you got john travolta 
[23:00]
 making loads of cash  he uh... started off as a sweat hog on welcome back on a correct so did  freddie boom boom washington let's see who's doing better  uh...  uh...  you know or sex do better  boom boom  i heard on the bus check up on blackface went down there to try to get arrested  but he can even get arrested on a top-up and this is a white-black issue and a  lot of white people are getting arrested i see that they're right there are  police headquarters said when do we should we try to get arrested like 
[23:30]
 without the colon stuff  no thanks open now i shan't be getting arrested because i think if you go  thing on their resting  and down there  you will get beat up  that's what i'm guessing that brad what do you got  a guy  you had to hear about uh...  reverend al sharpening the michael on a hunger strike  but i mean i think it is that i have some good  that's not on this side that's just a diet  forever now 
[24:00]

[28:30]
 political debate yeah  well but  uh... about everything i just said before  i could be wrong  uh...  you know or  or not  uh...  well that's why we like to say you never know what you get here we listen to  open open forum  that  little music to calm everyone down  phones are going on so i don't really feel like i spent the next hour and a  half discussing this now 
[29:00]
 swing jokes are a politics that's what you get here that's our motto that i  don't think so if you got anything else to talk about we'd love to hear  you know she the poor command  there's a little info on the uh... chinese writer where was anthony  uh... there you have it  uh...  the right when uh... you know she started whispering yeah the secret  ingredient that's when also and that you're listening my  and  he  double you and and i was at home i want to throw 
[29:30]
 the playstation through the window again  that's driving out of the final  it is the  i think that is plenty  but the pieces plenty of times where we're not funny  you know but that that's a that's a time that you should have laughed if you like  this job you know what i mean  though there is enough that  opportunities for us to screw up on our own yes  a peter  all p at the end of the entire trip by the fact that uh... no but after reading 
[30:00]
 the article about you have to remember was played by a maximum  uh...  was a reading maxima is a much you have to have to take a man and i think he  says this stuff is great that everyone should take it as a recreational drugs  uh... or let me take a quick twenty two-year-old guy who had actually no  problem that we have a hand up over the weekend yeah incredible  so i thought  i think you know i don't like your daughter  i was out of control five times in two hours guys no kidding now that i'm 
[30:30]
 happy at from what they were saying that they said that uh... it doesn't affect  people that are working uh... normally  state-of-the-art people back up a company that was working really  yes thing you know that they get that back up to stop this matter that  will take a bowl  so it's a so i was in why did you decide to take it  uh... actually one of my friend actually had a little problem but you  would be able to get a prescription for it  anybody got it all about not a terrible point on it 
[31:00]
 so i can only try it and i think  they tried to mark  wall really  and i got to give it a full endorsement and one of the girl thing  she was shocked you know that you have one or two times in form of the sleeper  grab a beer you know yes and i have not in between sessions we got a talk  carefully here on  did uh... go  south  bob  what but not fall  so it pretty much stayed uh...  a united state in the neighborhood you know how long have you uh... been with

 but you can  and i think that i think that i don't know  the same thing  i don't care how uh... three weeks three weeks is still like  you can remember what you look like when she's away right here you're still  having sex in every room and i read about on the staircase on the watch  that's that's all the excitement of a new relationship you idiot  uh... i got a lot of intense about my agro  uh... i don't know how  you know how much you are in love with your significant other i mean it you 
[32:30]
 know the sex drops a little bit  along here with someone i mean i was few weeks it you can do it anytime anywhere  yeah  i think that's  that money by agra  uh... but i used to do it on the roof and now i'm like  just praying to get a little something every  uh... i'll try to get another month of oil you know i want  and say you do that  now man we thought you're on to something that's like taking that's like  taking a cold medication when you don't have a cold and going to stop for  straight 
[33:00]
 mind that i can breathe fine  and uh... i've been selling it  uh... well  you have to do with the new girl  you know i mean  you gotta agree with us there  ideal colors back in fifteen years if you're the same girl let us know how  that by agro-zone and i got that guy before  uh...  that's funny  you know was that  are one of our forget it should be the part that we'll probably will probably  but just there are some really little bit further to music station 
[33:30]
 they don't live in the house again so we already made fun of you yeah  why you're going to be yet is job you don't even  but i don't go and remember the tweedle dumb and tweedle dumber line we remember  you from uh... your previous call  the other you about the public on top of the other people  work we're still talking a lot and you're still listening  well i think you know that is not a good good because when you want to get  template of the local laws you had this whole complaint two weeks ago i got it  right here in front of me and i still got a problem 
[34:00]
 i mean i think that you got a funny but you know i think that was the  but i think i still into the to remember this guy here like in in high school  so into the to lose their those like the to lose a feeling that you'll get out  of your car for a minute now that the so-called big scouts over to critical  listen to leave with a label listen to figure it out we're going to do what we  want around here  well i hope so but i hope you know big some input on the different  what we're going to wait what's wrong what's on you desperately need to hear 
[34:30]
 right now yeah  right now i'm talking about the public health of a lot of like our future by  the street out there  man's  homo  what all my god  the global  will be a little bit that's not old school that's almost cool  are you ok  what i wanted to say and you can pick any song in the world and you're picking  love is like oxygen well everything i do you do you do you think i'm sexy to do  you dance around your one-room apartment with a little whistle to go and tweet  tweet  no  no 
[35:00]
 the people who had a lot of man like what kind of  well i thought that i thought at least he was going to go here  that call for bed call off a bad call that something  it also i thought twenty years ago you can pick any song and you picked sweet  love is like oxygen  what do you want to pick  cats for a few of the daddy is something that are on i would have been much better  stranglehold would have uh... worked the love is like oxygen all of the  let me know what i would ever admit that they like i know 
[35:30]
 today come on a lot of rock and roll well we all have those songs we hear in  the car and all of them and what we're just glad that uh... knows around as we  crank it up and go well is pretty cool but if my friends her means you know  singer this day with a laugh at me yeah i'm not going to play that  rocket rock music with no  it's not the matter with the people  you know i don't know  or  don't know  yeah i think this is making a hot  what  point  and this must make you really hot and  what's the matter and in your apartment with your little sat in undies 
[36:00]
 uh...  uh...  setup for playing a song for you i know that makes you hot man type of music  come on  i was into my radio  my single with this day  and this sounds like a thread up your alley  no pun intended  st  and that made mainly complete and backlame by adapter einmal 
[36:30]
 start  your setup  that sweet so i want to see how this guy gets all turned on by sweet  cedric and i don't know how much of a lot of that  fox on the run a little better i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i 
[37:00]
 i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i  i don't know what the fuck the fuck i just requested any music on camera like  don't like it to you  question of what would you think that it would be good to do  i think that i don't like it  but he was in every call every day  every two weeks and you're still listening so there's something about us  that you can't get away  i think that the point of view that the fact that radio library the figure world  you got a better for our library  that's going to leave a lot of room when it's uh... 
[37:30]
 and i'm a hand-truck  the point that for the party crap not that not that they do it  training that record it was possible that's funny stuff that it's funny  listening to you try to speak english there right  you're going to talk about it was what is your right i don't think that it was  probably a dollar by listening to that we're going to make your day we're going  to play a little this for you i hope you get all turned on  i got a lot of this  come on 
[38:00]
 where does this on really make you hot  well  what like radio but back in those days when i was like world  i might be a lot of world for the speech though  uh...  yeah i'm wrong yeah listen to that come on man this is what it's all right here  i don't know i don't know radio tonight on john kershner's rock concert  doctor  he would be building god come on  what's the matter with you guys are you listening  uh... 
[38:30]
 this is like  and why you got the fact that one of your own patient i would be sweet though  you guys are the point for a list  of my point  i think we would be about it dot but i think we've had enough of you  yeah  yet to want to replay the last time he called  uh... is that necessary  but i think i will go ahead  the right in new york one oh two seven w any double you the latest from  collective sold as heavy 
[39:00]
 off dosage those guys most of them in say hi to us  i believe that still on later on this month  march almost over  yes  almost uh... springtime weather  stating the obvious  well i'm just saying that because uh...  we have something planned for spring uh... yes we do  uh...  can make uh... the tuesday night hammer club look like a joke  yep something nice for the uh... drive home  uh... 
[39:30]
 we should have been fired for this thing  we're able to skate by the last time we did this the cut close yes you got close  uh...  we couldn't do it when the weather was nice when we first got here  cuz you gotta kinda get to know us first yes  so let's get in  this new thing will happen soon right and then  yes i think  on the first  really nice wednesday  uh... that happens yeah  from right now i mean today's wednesday  yeah but you know if it was a nice day we would have broke out our new 
[40:00]
 promotion yes new open and the promotion  the first nice wednesday  warm temperatures you just know when you walk outside you go  uh... smells like rain yes you know that day yeah  when that's a wednesday make sure you listen to us you listen people will call  in on that hey it's wednesday and look tonight's day well what is it now it's  gotta be that  uh... it's spring you will know is yet  you would know my son  and you will see  so we can say about that  yeah we don't want somebody else jumping on it 
[40:30]
 some wacky and the jr  and that day  but we haven't come up with an original idea ourselves  court a lot of the listeners  uh... collective soul april second trade winds seabright and new jersey tickets on  sale now as well for them  okay  it was your song that you were gonna play today  many of them to fire  playlist and play song uh... you know we need the radio edit  uh... that's the only problem i got i got the whole cd in the car but uh... 
[41:00]
 there's too many absent  as is in the  a lot of curses that i'm talking about god smack  my favorite song out right now is uh... god smack  and the song is called whatever  back to xanth yeah  let's see if we play it then we'll have to break stuff in the studio and then  uh...  yeah  you know we kind of get a caught up in the moment  yeah we  kind of the of the rock and songs  all right uh... no i want to play really fast 
[41:30]
 because it's kind of frustrating  we have a cd out  that uh... no one could find  that's why we don't even really talk about anymore  so record company pretty much let us down when we moved to new york  you know we really don't have anyone listening to us so  they figure they didn't really need to have worked the cd  today we've sold i think  dot two hundred copies in new york which is  pretty sad considering the sold over  forty thousand cd everywhere else where you don't want to saturate the new york 
[42:00]
 market not course  two hundred that's that's plenty  so i don't know we should give out the phone  about the phone number for what  this is a lot of people are seeing it  dependent pencil  pen and pencil get a pen and  piece of paper  in a piss off our  so-called record company we haven't heard from him  okay  you want to do many world cd 
[42:30]
 write this number down  i'm totally serious  and ask them to send you one  so record company  uh... nine seven three  and seven three  five seven one  five seven one  nine four four four  nine four four four  they're not in the office anymore they only work about fifteen minutes a day so  try them tomorrow  and ask for mark  kyrgyzstan say look at them looking for the open at the demand world cd i've 
[43:00]
 given up trying to find it can you send me one  that ought to get them i'm serious okay what the phone ring all day tomorrow  nine seven three  five seven one  nine four four four if you want open at least a man world cd  okay good and as for mark kyrgyzstan  we're very proud of uh... the cd  were ready to make another one of us with you that's good in the works where  we're good already having meetings yes  those wonderful meetings yes 
[43:30]
 but uh... we're definitely proud of the demand world city but the next one we  put out skin below that away  but if you're looking for that uh... we have the number here rick will give it  to you if you weren't able to jot it down yes  but uh... one of the tracks in the matter world  is being uh... email test all the time  and people like one  they don't they don't realize it's us  if you've got a hundred grand wave file that's us  it's like in the rounds now and i'll see if i get it  email to our email address probably five times a day for you to check this out 
[44:00]
