 The good hair makes you a good man.  You wear good hair then you're a good man.  There we go, alright.  Wow, I'm on a streak, okay.  Do you want to move on or do you want to take a break?  No, no, keep going, keep going, come on.  Alright, alright, question six, Joe.  Okay, at dinner with Barry's parents, Bill is asked how many sweet potatoes he wants.  Does he want A, thirty, B, only one, or C, two or three?  I can't remember, it's got to be another, I'm going to say all the above, all the above. 
[00:30]
 All of the above?  I want thirty, I need one, two, three, I got to go with all of them.  Alright.  Thirty, he means one.  He means two and three.  Oh, wait, what was that?  He said thirty.  Yeah.  And then they said one.  And then his wife said two or three.  How do you want to judge that?  Half credit.  Yeah, we'll give you half.  Give me no credit over there.  Oh, no credit from the penis guy.  No credit.  No credit.  No credit.  Alright, next question.  Okay, during that same dinner, Bill was yelled at for misbehaving. 
[01:00]
 What was he doing?  This is easy.  Was he A, eating his wig, B, stealing all the chicken, or C, wiping his mouth with the  tablecloth?  He was, God, got to be the funniest part of the whole movie.  Chicken, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God,  chicken, oh boy, Bill loves chicken.  They put the platter next to him and he just unloaded the whole platter on his plate and 
[01:30]
 they're yelling at him, Bill, Bill, oh boy, Bill loves chicken.  Bill, you're on a diet.  Oh, I'm not.  So it's the chicken, obviously.  Isn't that good chicken?  It's good chicken, Bill.  Bill is on a diet.  He's watching his weight because of his leg.  Isn't that right, Bill?  I'm not watching my weight now.  Put that back.  I'm going to have more chicken. 
[02:00]
 Put that back.  I want more chicken.  Put that back.  Then he got all upset that Barry was yelling at him.  He ran in the kitchen and stood in the corner.  Alright, very good.  I'm sorry, Barry.  Alright, one question we have to eight.  Eight, okay.  Two more to go.  Bill befriends a little girl by the name of Amy.  While Amy was playing in the playground, Amy left something behind and Bill returned it to her.  What was that?  Is it A, a hat, B, a glove, or C, a scarf? 
[02:30]
 It was Amy's little glove.  And when he goes to give it back to her in the playground,  and she's all innocent and stuff, it's almost like that scene out of Frankenstein  where Frankenstein goes over to the little girl and he gives her the glove  and the teacher runs over horrified.  Bill, Bill, get away from that child.  Bill, don't you have work to do, Bill?  Bye, Amy.  So yes, it's the glove. 
[03:00]
 Amy, here's your glove.  Amy, here's your glove.  Okay, very good.  Is this the last one?  There's two more.  Two more, okay.  Okay.  Our Bill, as it seems, is a deeply religious man.  Can he make it through the Our Father?  Or A, he only lasts three seconds.  B, he makes it to give us this day.  Or C, he makes it all the way through. 
[03:30]
 This is obviously the scene where Amy is stricken with meningitis  and she's in the hospital and they let Bill in to visit.  So family only, but they let Bill in.  And Bill, in a touching moment, says a little prayer for Amy.  And he wants to say, Our Father.  But he can't get through.  Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed and given,  in heaven, o sweet child of mine.  It's pathetic. 
[04:00]
 I was roaring at this point and I believe Lisa had a weapon.  And she was beating me.  This is a real sensitive part of the movie.  Probably the most touching part where tears should be coming down your face.  Here we go.  There's the bad music.  High, B, A. It's Our Father who art in heaven. 
[04:30]
 He loses.  All right.  Seven right, two wrong.  So far, all right.  Very good.  Last question.  Last question.  For an 80 on my little quiz.  Above all, what is Bill most proud of?  Is it A, his wig, B, his teeth, or C, his coffee?  Hmm.  Very proud of his coffee.  I know that.  His hair made him a good man.  But he was very proud of his teeth.  Look, I got new teeth.  Look at my teeth, Barry.  So I gotta say teeth. 
[05:00]
 Yeah, that's how we met.  We're buddies now.  I got some new teeth.  I got some new teeth.  Wow.  All right, so I scored an 80.  80.  Eight out of ten.  All right.  Well, thank you.  I guess I gotta rent it again.  Yes, you do.  I missed two.  I missed a couple.  I'll do better next time.  I'll do better next time.  We gotta thank Joe from the courthouse for coming by with the Bill quiz. 
[05:30]
 Joe, great job.  It's great being here, guys.  We encourage you to maybe come up with some Godfather ones.  Jaws, Star Wars.  Sure, just name it.  Name it on the earth.  In the same fashion.  Yeah, we could give you the assignment.  Jaws and Godfather one.  Yeah.  That's a huge shot.  That'd be huge.  We'll have you come back with that, all right?  Definitely.  Just get a better recording technique, all right?  Or also, straight from the VCR to the tape deck.  I want to get that movie with Sean Cassidy and Linda Pearl.  That could be a go into.  Yeah, that's a good one.  All right.  Just like normal people.  I guess we could allow Joe to stick around and see if the three-boob chick is coming 
[06:00]
 up.  Oh, please.  That's his little payment.  Yeah, I know.  I've seen something like that except for Star Trek.  Well, supposedly she's going to be here at five.  Okay.  You know, I don't know if she's going to get scared and back out, but I hope not.  We're all eagerly awaiting her arrival.  Supposedly a girl named Jen has three boobs, two big Ds and a small B in the middle.  You got regular good boobs and one in the middle.  All right.  We're all just patiently waiting for Jen, the girl with three boobs.  Hopefully she will be on the radio with us soon. 
[06:30]
 Please.  I know.  We are begging and praying.  Please.  The instant feedback is going nuts, Jen, if you're on your way.  So don't get scared.  show us your three boobs.  All right.  The Rock of New York 1027W&W Pearl Jam from Live on Two Legs.  Elderly woman behind the counter in a small town.  And one of the albums up for grabs this weekend as we qualify people for our trip to the Grammys.  You qualify by winning an eight pack of CDs and then we'll have a grand prize winner that 
[07:00]
 we draw for the trip to LA for the Grammys.  More details to come.  Yes.  Anthony, patiently waiting for the girl with three boobs.  We don't know if she's going to show up or not at this point.  We'll be honest with you.  Well, we would like her to at least get in touch with us.  Yeah.  Give us a call either way.  You.  If you're coming or not because everyone is talking about the lady with three boobs.  Oh, I said yesterday I was extremely skeptical, but you know, you hope.  You hope for the best.  Of course you hope for the best.  And we're still hoping. 
[07:30]
 Uh, Scott from Allied and Seabright.  Where is she?  Mm hmm.  He's got a picture of what he thinks the three boobs look like.  Anthony, he even drew the middle one a little smaller.  Yes.  Um, we're leaving work in 20 minutes.  Please play either the, either the Tourette's guy calling the whorehouse or, or Steven Lynch's  gerbil song.  We haven't played that one.  Steven Lynch.  Friday.  Yeah.  Friday at our live broadcast.  We'll be joining us at the Longshore Brewery in Garden City.  Stereo.  Sorry about that.  We can't wait for Friday.  It's going to be great. 
[08:00]
 The whole thing is coming together now.  Uh, Steven Lynch is going to be there.  We got two trips to Miami to give away.  Uh, courtesy of Priceline.com.  Priceline.  And we're going to give those trips to the two biggest losers this Valentine's Day.  So we're looking for your pathetic stories.  Not only that, we're going to have a few consolation prizes too.  Mm hmm.  For some of the losers.  We're going to have a lot of stuff to give away.  They're going to be going home feeling pretty good.  Yes.  Just say that.  Okay.  I saw you on the internet.  Some of the stuff you're finding for this live broadcast is going to be pretty funny. 
[08:30]
 Of course.  Also, Tara's going to be there.  The hottest girl ever to pose naked for the Opian Anthony show.  Yes.  We're going to crown her this Friday.  Mm hmm.  She's going to do a little lingerie show.  Yes.  And your brother's coming down with his guitar and you guys are going to do a couple of song  parodies.  Musical director, Joe, will be joining us.  Yeah, we're going to pump out some of the song parodies.  Do the pipe song.  Maybe the Bill Clinton splooge song.  Yeah.  We've got a few that we could pull out.  Okay.  It's going to be really, really cool.  We can't wait for Friday. 
[09:00]
 It's an afternoon, evening full of fun and hijinks, I believe, Opi.  There you have it.  Get there early because we're expecting a pretty big crowd.  It's the Longshore Brewery in Garden City this Friday from three to seven.  Directions on the web?  Correct.  Good.  Correct.  Now, we can either play the Tourette's Warhouse call from our Domain of World CD, which by  the way is still not in any record stores in Manhattan.  It's going to get me started.  And then the record company gets mad at us because we say that, but the fact is like  every store has one copy. 
[09:30]
 So people are still having a hard time finding that damn thing.  It's out there.  If you look scavenger hunt.  Yeah.  And I'm trying to queue up really fast here.  Corky sings Poison Ivy.  Corky.  Another Corky song.  Yes.  I think we got a bad card or something.  Hold on.  Let me say, just hit stop on that, dude.  Yeah.  Damn it.  All right.  We're going to have to queue that up.  God.  We'll have to queue that up.  But if you were listening yesterday, we got Corky's CD and we played Obla Di Obla Da. 
[10:00]
 Who knew?  Chris Burke, the guy that played Corky on Life Goes On, hooked up with these two guys  and have a band.  I got an email yesterday too, from some guy at some camp in Plainview on Long Island,  that every year Corky and these guys would come and perform for the crowd.  And they'd all wear these Hawaiian shirts and risky business sunglasses.  Corky has a girlfriend.  Who this guy said it was hysterical.  He'd be making out with her.  In between their gigs.  God, what a mess. 
[10:30]
 Corky getting some.  Corky going to be good up on that ass.  All right.  Well, we're going to, I don't know, we'll do that next actually.  But it's a dirty card.  We got to.  It's a dirty card.  We got to get another copy.  Yeah.  You're a dirty card, aren't you?  All right.  In the meantime.  Going to put a little swab of alcohol on you.  You're a dirty card.  All right.  In the meantime, we're screwed up here now because the car's not working.  We're fine.  Look at black girls cleaning the heads.  Very good.  My brother. 
[11:00]
 Got a unique singing style, Scott, on lead vocals for Creed.  That's one from my own prison on the Rock in New York.  One oh two seven W-A-W.  One oh one.  My brother.  I like those guys.  And when they performed that in Letterman, he really got into it.  Yeah.  Backs off from the mic.  He does that like this mic move, man, where he's like, way back.  Yeah.  Back and he's got the mic.  Forward the mic's three feet away and he's yelling, whoa. 
[11:30]
 All right.  So, Pete, Anthony, patiently waiting for the three boob chick to show up.  We might've been scammed.  We'll be honest.  We're not sure though.  We haven't heard from her.  If she did scam us, we'd like you to call in so you could tell everyone that you scammed  us.  That would be cool in itself.  Yeah, if she did, you people were scammed along with us.  But we're still holding out hope.  We are holding out hope.  In the open Anthony lobby, we do have the first challenger to Tara's title. 
[12:00]
 She's out there.  She's out there.  All right.  A lady named Spike who's wearing a lot of leather, I guess.  We put the challenge out.  We put Tara's picture up on the website.  She is officially the hottest girl ever to take her clothes off on the Opium Anthony  show.  Some people have been bitching and complaining that she isn't that hot.  So we put the challenge out.  You think you're hotter, come on in.  We'll snap some pictures, put them on the website.  The people will decide who is hotter. 
[12:30]
 We finally have a challenger.  We have a challenger.  We'll talk to her next.  Spike.  Spike.  All right.  This is how it goes.  We'll put her pictures up.  Tara's pictures will still be up.  the website and you look at both pictures and then you have to vote.  We have to make some rules here.  We'll take the first thousand votes.  Yeah, that sounds good.  First thousand votes and then we'll crown a champion.  See if Tara keeps her title or if we got a new hottest girl to ever pose naked on the  Opium Anthony show.  So we might not have the three-boob chick in here, but we do have Spike coming in. 
[13:00]
 We better get the three-boob chick.  All right.  from Donna in Old Bridge, New Jersey.  Donna's got a great email address, by the way, Anthony.  What is it?  Spanky Kitty.  Spanky Kitty?  Spanky Kitty.  I think Donna is a dirty girl.  Yeah.  Yeah, Spanky Kitty.  Oh, you're so dirty.  Anyway, Donna writes, you guys are the best.  Me and my husband listen to you all the time. 
[13:30]
 You guys are such a bad influence on us.  Last night we were at a wake and a man with Down syndrome came in and my husband turned  to me and said, corn dog and Corky Steinbrenner's voice.  Oh no.  I about died.  I laughed right in the middle of a prayer service.  Oh, we're not trying to make people laugh at funerals and laugh at poor, retarded people.  Please keep us, keep up the good work.  Love you.  That's not a promote Bridge, New Jersey. 
[14:00]
 Oh boy.  And the corn dog man.  Did you see, um...  Well, is Corky Steinbrenner in the news because didn't Tim McCarver sign with the Yankees  to broadcast their games?  I'm looking.  It says the boss turns Mets error into Yanks hit.  This is a McCarver.  We'll be announcing Yankee games.  Like 42 Yankee games, yeah.  Oh, I can't wait to see Corky Steinbrenner on the tube tonight.  Tim McCarver is the best announcer in baseball.  And to have him announce Yankee games is the dream come true for me. 
[14:30]
 Tim, you want a corn dog?  Tim, I want a corn dog!  Tim, I want a corn dog!  Occasionally I see that clip of George from the World Series.  Every time I hear it now, I'm on the floor, I can't breathe.  My kidneys hurt, it laughs so damn hard.  Because they sold that videotape, you know, the Yankees, a wonderful year, buy your videotape 
[15:00]
 of the Yankees victory, blah, blah, blah.  And they have the locker room scene where George is accepting the trophy.  With his crazy Eddie outfit and his old drunk and his face looks all drawn as war?  To accept this trophy from you?  For the best team in baseball?  Yeah!  We had Coney in here and he pretty much admitted, not officially, but he kind of hinted that  George was really tanked up.  Just whacked. 
[15:30]
 Just whacked on booze.  And for everybody who remembers the George of the late 70's, you know, on the fights with Billy Martin.  Just, he was always a ball buster, I'm the boss.  And then to see him like that, he's all crying and all just a mess.  I love you guys.  The best team in baseball!  Well, speaking of Corky, we finally got a good version of Poison Ivy that we got to play on the air here. 
[16:00]
 This is the Chris Burke CD, the guy that played Corky on Life Goes On, hooked up with two guys and recorded some tunes.  What a great idea.  What were these two guys thinking?  We need somebody to help us on vocals.  Who's available?  Oh, the retarded kid from that TV show.  Yeah, that ought to throw in the vocal.  Well, yesterday, Obladi Obladi was such a huge hit, we decided to play another Corky song for you guys.  And he doesn't sing through the whole thing. 
[16:30]
 It's kind of difficult to pick out who Corky is in the song, but listen along, see if you could point out where Corky chimes in.  Well, you'll be ringing the bell every time Corky sings, right?  Of course.  And count how many times Anthony rings the bell?  Because it might become an Open Anthony trivia question.  When we do the Grammy thing, this is coming Friday, okay?  All right.  So an extra reason to pay attention here, but here we go.  It's Corky singing Poison Ivy. 
[17:00]
 Yeah.  Now we're rocking.  This is awful.  Corky.  Corky. 
[17:30]
 Corky.  All gay.  We're after four.  Oh yeah.  Five. 
[18:00]
 Six.  Seven.  Eight.  I drank it. 
[18:30]
 What?  Oh man.  Corky.  Look, look, Opie's dancing. 
[19:00]
 Ocean.  Almost done.  Bring it down.  Oh my God.  This is awful. 
[19:30]
 There it is.  There's your grand total.  Keep that in mind.  And I believe it was 14.  We'll quiz you on it.  We'll quiz you Friday.  Most likely.  Better watch out.  I have a syndrome.  It's called down.  Poison Ivy.  All right.  We're going to talk to Spike and take some pictures of her to see if she has what it takes to dethrone Tara.  All right, Anthony. 
[20:00]
 We got to talk about Playboy, our latest sponsor to the program.  And they want us to talk about the March issue, which is a very cool issue.  I think it's going to be a collector's item.  It's the Girls of Kiss issue.  It's on newsstands now.  It's on the cover with three men, just smoking ladies with kiss makeup on.  And then you go inside.  And what do you get?  You get like 30 girls.  Well, what do you get inside?  You get lots of snatch.  I don't think that is how Playboy wants to be presented. 
[20:30]
 What?  I thought we were doing it.  No, no.  See, that's your problem.  You have the copy of Swank in your hand.  No, I.  Put the Swank down.  Now see, there's the Playboy.  That's a classy gentleman's magazine.  Well, what do you call that?  That is a lovely.  Hitler must have region of.  No, but you're not getting what you know.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I just got carried away, you know, but the centerfolds cool too.  You don't want the shots of. 
[21:00]
 There's two centerfolds.  Bonus time.  Oh, wow.  That is look at us just silent.  Oh, look at that.  No, I like Playboy.  It's classy.  You don't get those shots of the girls that look like down below.  It looks like Fidel Castro eating a filet mignon.  You know that I don't.  I'm not into that.  All right.  So you got the centerfold.  How old is she?  1978.  Just one in 78.  That's scary.  Oh, my God.  Wow. 
[21:30]
 I was in high school.  All right.  And then you got the other centerfold with 30 women.  Yeah.  And the kiss makeup surrounded by the whole band.  That's that's very, very cool.  Very, very cool.  Besides that in this issue, you got some an interview, I guess, with Lauren Hill.  Lauren Hill.  I said this earlier.  I want to stress this point, Opie.  Lauren Hill.  You know that big upper lip she has?  Yes.  You know, for her lips.  Yeah, it's not real.  It's not real.  She draws in her lip with a big lipstick thing.  She's got a very thin upper lip.  You saw Lauren Hill naked.  Yeah.  She's got a very thin upper lip.  She's got a very thin upper lip.  Yeah. 
[22:00]
 She's got a very thin upper lip.  Yeah.  She's got a very thin upper lip.  with a big lipstick thing.  She's got a very thin upper lip.  You saw Lauren Hill naked.  No.  What?  What are you?  Her mouth.  Oh, her mouth.  OK.  Also, an interview with the Beastie Boys.  Oh my.  An interview with Horny Drew Carey.  And also an interview with Rudy Giuliani.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're going to talk to Spike next to see if she's got what it takes to dethrone Tara as  the hottest girl to ever appear naked on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[22:30]
 The Rock of New York 1027W and EW with David Bowie.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Quick facts here from JNR Music World.  They're pissed at us.  Why?  It says, referring your effing CD, Opie and Anthony, we, as I have fact-stewed before,  have your CD in stock and plenty of it.  We have not been out of it as long as you have been on the air.  So F you.  Cassettes too.  That's from Joe.  JNR Music World.  That's in Manhattan, downtown, across from City Hall.  Hey, Joe.  How about a little display? 
[23:00]
 Put down an Opie and Anthony display for us.  Help us out a little bit.  Put ass wipes as heard on any W or something.  Be creative.  Yeah, make fun of us.  We don't care.  All right.  All right.  Well, the three-boobed chick, who knows?  Maybe she got in a car accident or something.  We haven't heard from her.  She hasn't stopped by.  Have no idea if she's scamming us or not.  She's on her way from a mammogram and it just takes a little longer.  Just a little longer.  We've still got something else for you guys today and ladies. 
[23:30]
 We've got Spike, who is entering the studio as we speak.  All right.  Spike thinks she's got what it takes to dethrone Tara as the hottest girl ever to appear naked  on the Opie and Anthony show.  Wow, you're pretty wild looking.  Just a little bit.  Wow.  She's dressed in ...  You've got like the Marilyn Manson look going on.  Kind of.  Yeah, everyone says that at work.  Wow.  She's got a whole leather outfit on.  She's got handcuffs, a collar around her neck, black hair, dark eyes. 
[24:00]
 Chicks like you scare them to death.  It just frightens me.  Silver lipstick.  People pay me to scare them.  That's cool.  She's got the long zippers down the sides.  Man.  I have to get it off easier.  She's got a whip.  Let's see the whip.  Just crack that off.  Here, take that off and crack that.  It's like a cat-o'-twenty tails.  That wasn't quite hard enough.
