 The Rock of New York, 1027W, IDW, Jimi Hendrix, Voodoo Childs, Light Return.  Collective Soul, their latest run from their Dosage CD.  And we're premiering that album tonight at 11 o'clock right here on NW.  If you want to hear what the rest of Collective Soul's latest is all about.  Wunderbar.  What's up?  It's Sophie and Anthony.  Hello there.  Before you ride home.  How are we today?  I feel like crap.  What's your problem? 
[00:30]
 I don't know.  I got a nasty headache.  Oh, that's how it starts.  What do you mean?  The flu thing.  No, don't say that.  I've avoided the flu, but I'm getting everything else.  I think it's a stress headache.  What are you stressing about?  This place.  Hello?  But it is getting better.  Good.  It really is starting to get a lot better around here.  So I don't know why I'm still getting these stress headaches, but it might be because  you made me laugh so hard last night.  Well, that's a good thing.  That monkey meat stuff and the retarded sex. 
[01:00]
 I thought some hell about that one.  I think that's what it is.  I don't think it's stress headaches.  I think it's you making me laugh so hard.  It's happening like blood vessels in my brain.  Well, good.  Your misery will be everybody else's pleasure.  But I'm going to be fine.  Because I popped six aspirates.  You've got to take real aspirin, man.  I can't take that Tylenol.  I do profan, Advil, Crapola.  It's got to be extra strength, excedrin. 
[01:30]
 Well, that's what you gave me.  And so far, it's not working.  Come on.  So I popped some Tylenol.  Ah.  What?  I'm telling you the truth.  This stuff never works.  I'm not going to sit here and fake it.  I'm going to take the real deal.  Hey, I got to bring up something really fast.  Did you see the Guinness Book of World Records last night?  Damn, no.  Ah.  I tell you about it every week.  You got to check it out.  I'm usually, you know what it is?  We get home relatively late from here.  And I eat dinner at that time.  And I cannot watch that Guinness Book of World Records show 
[02:00]
 while I'm eating dinner.  It's disgusting.  That's the best time to watch it.  Oh, please.  This just goes with the whole thing.  Meeting spaghetti, and they're talking about the record  for eating worms or something.  And I can't deal with that.  Well, we saw the snap-on face guy in the past.  We thought that was pretty gross, right?  Yeah, big guy.  A guy had a divot taken out of his head.  He had, yeah, the whole front of his face  is snap-on, where you could fit a softball right  through the middle of his face.  And he had snap-on ears and stuff.  You thought that was gross?  Yes.  You thought the lady with the 300-pound tumor 
[02:30]
 that they operated on was gross?  Where they had just got the heebie-jeebies.  Where they took the tumor away in a wheelbarrow  after they removed it from her.  And it had hair and teeth growing in it.  Yes.  Well, last night, they outdid themselves.  They found a guy who is living with his heart  beating outside his body.  Stop it.  Stop it.  For some reason, this is a Guinness Book of World Records.  Yeah, what kind of record is that?  They perverted that show into something, a freak show. 
[03:00]
 They have made a new record, the guy living  with a heart outside his body for the longest time.  Isn't that ridiculous?  What kind of record is that?  A freak show.  That's exactly what it is.  When are they going to have Pickled Punks?  Yeah, they should fess up and just call it the Guinness  Book Freak Show.  Of course.  Step right up, ladies and gentlemen.  See, the Pickled Punks.  Yeah, you know that's coming next.  They had some great footage of this guy.  He was born with his heart outside his body.  They showed the pictures.  There's his heart with a slight covering over it. 
[03:30]
 Ah, inside his body.  And what they said was when the mother gave birth,  they just kind of put it in the corner of the hospital room,  just assuming it's going to die in a couple hours.  Well, the damn thing continues to live.  So they're like, wow, we better operate and try to do something.  They couldn't get it back in his body because his chest cavity  was too small.  Get out of here.  So they decided the safest bet was to just leave it outside his body.  So they kind of just put it under the skin, though.  It wasn't even under the skin. 
[04:00]
 Darn, man.  So now the kid, he lives in Philadelphia,  and he's the mayor of South Philly.  That's what he's called, the mayor of South Philly.  And he's now 23 years old, and he's still living.  Dude, and of course, Guinness Book of World Records,  they had to go the distance.  So they're talking about the story and showing the old footage  and stuff.  Now they got a picture of him as a 23-year-old kid  in his apartment on the phone talking to his bud with his shirt off.  No.  With the heart just, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Come on.  You saw his heart? 
[04:30]
 Oh, yeah, just bouncing right in front.  Well, you didn't see the actual heart,  but you see the skin just drastically moving forward.  Oh, my God.  So the way he does, the way he lives, because obviously, you  can't go around like that.  Someone elbows you, you're going to have, you know.  Yeah, you'd be dead.  So they got this special, like, breastplate he has to wear  constantly.  D-Lo Brown from the WWF, he has to wear a chest plate.  That's exactly what it is.  Same type of thing.  And they show him playing basketball.  And stop.  It was just out there.  That's not a record. 
[05:00]
 It's a freak show.  And then they got, you know, they have the graphics come down,  and it's like, you know, a person living with a heart outside his body  for the longest time.  A new record.  Stupid.  What a great show, though.  Can't watch it.  And then they had the snake guy last night.  He set the record.  He lies in a bathtub.  Yeah.  They had 37 or 30 something rattlesnakes rattlesnake in there with him.  Really?  Yeah.  Interesting.  And the guy had no hair.  So they made like a rattlesnake hairpiece for him. 
[05:30]
 Yeah.  One of the rattlesnakes.  And that set some type of record.  And that set a record.  Yeah.  I thought most people weren't doing dangerous records anymore.  That's what they said, right?  Yeah, they don't do the bury the live record.  They don't recognize that.  And they don't do the hold your breath underwater record anymore.  Because they're dangerous.  But a bathtub full of rattlesnakes is fine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  OK.  And it's been in the media in the past few years that the Guinness Book of World Records  have become PC.  Yeah.  Like if you get the latest edition of the book, you don't really get to see a lot of 
[06:00]
 the freaks anymore.  Yeah.  You don't get to see the fat twins on the bike anymore.  Or the midgets and the fidgets are good.  The fidgets and the real fat people and stuff.  I like Chang and Wang.  The sun and the twins.  Yang and Pang.  Yang and Pang.  Hawk and Polk.  Yeah.  Those guys connected by the chest.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They were the sickest people to ever live on this Earth.  Because they ended up getting married to separate women and having like 20 kids between them. 
[06:30]
 What the hell did that bedroom look like?  I don't know how you do that.  I don't know either.  Interesting.  So there you go.  I thought I'd share.  Guinness Book of World Records freak show on every what?  Tuesday night.  I shan't be watching.  Why?  I gotta eat.  I'm taping for later.  The guy with the heart outside the body.  That's right down your alley, Anthony.  No it isn't.  I don't like disgusting stuff.  You don't like to see stuff like that?  No.  That's why people always sending me that website.  Rotten.com.  They go, Anthony, you gotta check this out. 
[07:00]
 What makes people think I want to see people impaled on poles and with their heads chopped  off and after traffic accidents splattered on the road?  Well, they listen to our radio show and they assume it's right down your alley.  That's all.  No, no.  Sex is great.  I will tune into that on the internet and at the drop of a hat, if you got a link to  that.  But the gross stuff, that does nothing for me.  It disturbs me.  See, that's weird.  It doesn't disturb me.  No, I can't do that.  It gives me nightmares.  I enjoy checking it out.  Some guy emailed me a picture and it was titled Hot Babe. 
[07:30]
 And I click on it and it starts to download.  And I see the top of her head and it's like, oh cool, this is going to be good.  It keeps going down, down until it gets to her mouth.  It turned out some kind of horrible accident where a piece of metal hit her right in the  mouth and cut her jaw off.  And I'm looking at this like, gee thanks, why would I want to see this?  It's disturbing.  You guys send me the good jibs.  No, come on.  Don't.  The jib pegs. 
[08:00]
 I swear, I'm dumping every photo I get without even opening them.  No way.  Send the jib pegs.  I get bastard.  I'm not going to be able to open anything.  I'll send them out and forward them right to OPI.  It's fine.  I'll check them out.  Good.  Check them out, you sick.  I don't, I'm pretty desensitized at this point.  Well, that's really healthy.  That's a great healthy attitude to have.  Well, the only thing in recent years that really got to me was when we talked to that  lady that cleaned up the crime scenes.  That really got to me.  See, that didn't bother me. 
[08:30]
 Why?  Because she was just talking about it.  When I look at pictures of real people mangled.  Yeah, but she was describing some of the scenes.  She's cleaned up in the past.  Who cares?  That's like a movie.  Oh, no way.  You know, but when you see pictures of real people just hacked apart, it disturbs me.  All right.  Very nice.  Send them to OPI, not to Anthony.  Thank you.  Also, real fast, I want to thank Clinton for visiting our fine city yesterday.  Yeah, well, in the paper he says he owes New York a huge debt. 
[09:00]
 He loves it.  He has an inexpressible gratitude to New Yorkers.  So he expresses that by just clogging traffic up.  Yeah.  Last night while everybody's trying to get home, they closed the Grand Central, they  closed the LIE, the bridges.  You never know where he's going to be.  They closed roads.  It was a nightmare last night.  Yeah, horrible.  Horrible.  Getting out of town.  He clogged traffic like he clogged Monica.  Last night.  Jesus. 
[09:30]
 What?  Well, OK, I guess so.  Come on.  Nightmare.  That analogy.  Sure.  You're right.  That's a little rough.  But we can work on that, I guess.  All right.  All right.  On the way, we got another track from the Black Crows, By Your Side CD.  Great song from the doors.  And we're all set and ready to go here, gang.  Fax line 212-957-W-N-E-W. Phone line is ready to go.  And we got the instant feedback.  Just go to the W-N-E-W website.  1027-W-N-E-W, the Rock of New York. 
[10:00]
 Pearl Jam live this time around from Live on Two Legs.  That's daughter.  It's OPI and Anthony.  We're hanging.  And got a great instant feedback here from Brian from Midtown.  You know what's funny about this show?  We'll hit on some stuff, and then you go home,  and you watch the news.  Yeah.  And you just die laughing.  We're already getting a bunch of people calling that they  couldn't watch the story about the groundhog that died in Canada  because we goofed on that yesterday.  So when the story came on the news last night as a serious story, 
[10:30]
 people lost it.  Did you see the picture on the paper?  Yeah, he's in his little cute coffin.  Yeah, they put the groundhog in a coffin.  And he's got his little groundhog hands all perched up on his chest.  He's just laying there with big buck groundhog teeth.  He's laying in a pine coffin.  And the people are around him all morning and everything, feeling bad.  And I almost spit up my dinner last night and watching the news.  And they had the monkey meat story.  Yeah. 
[11:00]
 Yeah, I saw that one last night, too.  It's supposed to be a serious story about how AIDS started  from people eating monkey meat.  But after the whole Charlton Heston last few days,  I can't watch the story.  It's just too funny.  Too freaking funny.  And with that in mind, Brian from Midtown writes,  Anthony and Opie, yesterday the subject was retard sex in your show.  Well, this is no joke.  But there are retarded people that get on my bus in Queens every day.  This morning, two of them were making out in the back of the bus. 
[11:30]
 I swear to God.  It was like a car crash when you really, really, really don't want to look,  but you're compelled to look for some reason.  The worst part was that right as they stopped and were about to get off the bus,  the guy said to the girl, your mouth tastes funny.  I accidentally busted out laughing because all I could think of was Anthony  and Corky Steinberg's voice saying, and it tastes like a corn dog.  So now there is a busload of people who know that I'll be in hell. 
[12:00]
 Anyway, this is all true.  So help me God. Brian in Midtown.  That's funny.  It tastes like a corn dog.  Just do that. Your mouth tastes funny, please.  Your mouth tastes funny.  Man, I was just catching hell yesterday.  Emails and letters.  How could you use the word retard and retard sex?  I don't know. 
[12:30]
 That movie clip for the other sister.  That movie is coming out with Julia Lewis, where she plays the retard.  She hooks up with a guy, retard, and then retard sex.  They're going through the pages of the joy of sex.  And I don't know. I find that a little standoffish.  And someone sent us a fax and said,  are you guys getting money for promoting that new movie?  Yeah, like the only reason anyone's going to see it now is because they want to  like goof on Julia Lewis and this guy.  When their right mind's going to see that trailer, not think about retard sex. 
[13:00]
 Which, by the way, we don't have officially a definition for.  No, it's just we asked you guys yesterday, what is the definition of retard sex?  It doesn't necessarily have to do with disabled people.  And so far we don't have the official definition for retard sex.  So that's how you could play along at home, if you like.  Consent of fax or an instant feedback on that.  Yeah. Andy from North Arlington writes,  the definition of retard sex, having sex with my husband. 
[13:30]
 One or two seven W.  N.E.W. The Rock in New York, the boss from tracks with seven angels.  It's open, Anthony, just getting warmed up here.  But the show is coming together quite nicely.  Keep the email and the faxes and the phone calls are coming.  We love your participation on the show.  Todd from Jersey writes,  she's up and act.  Can you please replay the girl giving a road hummer from yesterday's show? 
[14:00]
 No, it's rule. Keep rocking.  I think that they might have made it into the  never to be played again category, the forbidden file, the forbidden fire.  Yes. You know what we should do?  We should make a website with all our forbidden bits that you only get to hear once.  And then we get in big trouble for. Yes.  We can't blame again. Put them on the website.  Oh, I like that. It's not a bad idea.  Yeah. Maybe someone could start that that bootlegs are so  because I think if it came from us, we'd get in trouble for that as well. 
[14:30]
 Well, there's a little controversy about that that bit yesterday.  I think the people upstairs in management are a little uneasy about  that bit yesterday. Anthony, why is that?  Well, I don't know.  We had a lovely couple in the car yesterday on the ride home on Route 78  and night on my club.  And yeah, they thought it was a perfect opportunity to  join the club. Right.  Hmm. And we can't confirm that the lady was actually 
[15:00]
 getting the D done. Right.  Sound like her mouth was full, but who are we to judge?  Exactly. I thought it was harmless.  It was some fundraiser. Yeah.  Yeah, man. I could hear the guy's voice.  I'm getting very breathy. Yeah. Yeah.  It's like I can't go home.  And then he said he was swerving all over the road.  I wonder if that couple made it home safely.  If they're listening, I think they need to give us a call today.  Yeah. Let them know. Let us know how they did. Yeah. 
[15:30]
 But I'm not sure if that bit is officially made the forbidden file yet.  We might be able to sneak one more play out of it before we have to trash it.  You think so? Oh, I could go either way.  No one has told us officially that we're not allowed to play it right.  I mean, if I just like happened to push play here and it played.  Yeah. I mean, I can do that.  You can. I think I could do that.  Because now I'm thinking we better get this on the air before they tell us not to 
[16:00]
 play it again.  True. That's because now that we brought it up on the radio, I'm sure they're  running running from down, you know, upstairs to tell us no.  Right. So you want to play one more time?  Yeah, let's hear if it's you listen at home to if it you think it's the actual  article. It's really happening.  Yeah. Yeah. Give us your feedback on this.  If this offends you or if this is the type of thing you like to hear on the radio  from time to time, we'll preface it like that.  I just want to know if it's real or not. Really?  Yeah. All right. Let's take a listen. 
[16:30]
 Any W. What's up? Hey, I wanted to know if I can get on the air because if I did,  I told my husband, I'd give him a hammer for hammer Tuesday.  We're driving home from work. You're on the air. I'm on the air.  Yes. Well, then I guess I gotta go to work.  Now, what road are you guys on?  Route 78. No kidding.  Now, who's driving? He is.  Uh oh.  Oh, no.  If you're on route 78, watch out, guys.  Yes, sir. Thanks, guys.  Wait, wait, wait, wait. Give him the phone.  Hold on. We'll see how far we can go with this. 
[17:00]
 Which one of the wackos do I have?  Both of us. I love you guys.  Thanks. I'm a big fan of you guys.  Are you officially a member of the club or are you going to become a member?  I'm going to be real soon.  Yeah?  Is that she's going to do it on the road?  She's aware. I said, you are every Tuesday.  I come home and I'm like, it's hammer Tuesday.  Hammer Tuesday.  And I've been beating on her so we're keeping her home tonight.  I'm like, you owe me one. It's hammer Tuesday.  Well, what do you say you at least get things started right now? 
[17:30]
 That works for me.  All right. Let her rip.  Gotta get started, honey.  All right. Just describe what she's doing carefully.  Right now I'm zipping my drawer.  All right. And how fast are you going?  Right now I'm all over the road.  How fast did I go? Are you kidding me?  I got a couple of cars in front of me.  I'm going to probably start smashing into them.  Well, be careful.  Be careful how to help with it.  It's worth it.  All right. Now, what's going on now?  Well, we're starting. 
[18:00]
 I wish you guys were here.  No, that's not what I wanted.  Actually, what's that doctor's name? Dr. Corn?  Yeah.  She's a pastor.  Yeah, she really is. We're going to have her back on the show.  What you got to do is see if I can get a chapter in her book.  So what do you think of the impeachment hearings?  Actually, I'm counting sheep right now.  I want to make sure I last a little longer, you know?  Oh, my God. 
[18:30]
 I put the phone down there. I got to talk to her real fast.  Okay. Hold on one sec.  I'm a little busy.  I got... I'm just starting.  All right. Well, we'll let you love birds go.  Thanks.  All right.  See you.  All right. Wow.  If anyone else is on Route 78, look out.  There's a car that's swerving all over the damn road.  Well, I would say... 
[19:00]
 real.  I don't know.  Oh, here comes management. They're walking down the hall.  I'd like to think.  Really?  Really?  Yeah, but they're not coming in.  Figures.  Thanks, Todd, from Jersey. You guys are in trouble.  They're waiting for us to turn the mics off.  Oh, wait. I just punched up the Victoria's Secret fashion show.  You did?  It's online right now, they say.  Well, the pregame is on.  Why? It's supposed to be what? 
[19:30]
 07?  Yeah, the fashion show starts at 07, but they've got all sorts of pregame stuff going on.  Yeah, but it's real audio or real player, you know?  What am I looking at?  It's on QB.  That's going to be cool.  You know?  They've got to figure this stuff out.  At 07 o'clock, they're going to have a fashion show live on the Internet.  Yeah, but it would be good enough to check out and go,  wow, that's kind of neat.  Internet video isn't quite like the Jetsons yet, you know?  When Mr. Slate or Mr. Spacely would be on a big screen going, 
[20:00]
 you're fired!  Jetson!  Yeah, he's clear as a bell.  He wasn't all cubed out, right?  True.  We're supposed to be at that point.  You didn't have to wait for buffering and stuff.  No.  When he was firing Jetson, it was immediate.  He must have had a cable modem, Anthony.  Yeah.  That looks like Patch.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hi, what's up?  That was real, man.  You think so?  Yeah, unless she had a pair of marbles in her mouth at the time. 
[20:30]
 I mean, the acoustics, the rapid breathing.  Yeah.  You went to town on the guy.  Yeah, I know.  That's what we're thinking.  He's a hero to us all.  He's a hero to us all.  That's pretty much illegal radio right there.  And there's probably about a hundred husbands wishing they were married to that particular  female.  There you go.  Hi, man.  And she's a Joan of Arc of the Oval Office.  Well, cool.  Yeah, I love the show, man.  You guys crack me up.  Hey, thanks a lot. 
[21:00]
 All right, dude.  Bye.  Well, that's a vote for it's real.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hi, yeah.  I'm sorry I missed the show yesterday.  Glad you reran it.  And my vote is that's the quality programming I've come to expect from your show.  There you go.  Thank you.  Now, how old are you?  Thirty-five.  Right on.  All right.  Thanks.  I'm in the perfect demographic.  So, you know, that's the kind of audience you want to hit.  You want to hear something like that every once in a while, something just out there,  right?  Oh, yeah. 
[21:30]
 My favorite bit you guys had is cleat motors.  Yeah, we love cleat motors.  Oh, man.  Every time I come home, it's like, I heard cleat motors.  Come on, let's go.  I know.  The problem is we've played that bit so many times.  I don't know if we can play it today, but we'll play it in the future.  Good, good, good.  Keep that in your repertoire.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Thanks, guy.  Keep going.  Hi, N.E.W.  Yeah?  Yeah, what's up?  She didn't do it.  Yeah, she wasn't doing it.  And if she was, she wasn't doing it right because he wouldn't have been talking if  I was doing it.  Oh, there you go. 
[22:00]
 He would have never been able to talk.  Well, it just begun, though.  No, but what we still want.  All right, you sound like a passenger side hosebag.  No, because there's no way she can do it.  Listen, I told you guys a few times, my friend Tony Romano drives home every night from work,  takes him an hour.  I told him I'd make him a member of the Hummer Club any night that he wants.  But he's married to someone else or something like that?  Yes, but he doesn't get it. 
[22:30]
 And you would do it for him?  I told him to drive him home, but he wouldn't be able to drive.  He'd have to pull over.  Oh, really?  Yes.  There's no way.  He wouldn't be laughing until the door closed and then boom, boom, boom, boom.  No, sorry, no.  Okay.  And who's in the background?  All the people you work with?  No, I'm not at work.  I'm home.  Is that kids?  No, I'm working at the show.  Oh, that's what I'm hearing in the background.  Bouncing back.  Okay.  Are you really a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club?  I certainly am.  Look at that.  Girl looks very sure of herself.  I like that.  And how old are you?  I'm 30.  Right on.  That's what we want to hear. 
[23:00]
 Cool.  Yes.  All right.  I listen to you guys all the time.  You're great.  Thank you.  And please mention something to Tony Romano.  He gets help for working 10 minutes.  Well, you already have.  You already have.  When are you going to play it?  You are live on the radio.  Oh, well, he's not in his car yet.  Well, someone will tell Tony that you're on the radio and confessing your love for his  love.  Swing.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Thanks.  Bye.  Wonderful.  Hi, N.E.W.  That was a superb encore performance.  You like that, huh? 
[23:30]
 I like it a lot.  I was wondering maybe is there a Tuesday Night Hummer Club theme song that Stephen Lynch  could make up for the club?  You know, we haven't asked him for one, but I'm sure he would gladly make a song for us.  I would love to hear like the whole Scott Mead 2 Beatle song.  Open your show.  Two Stephen Lynch songs.  Yeah, he's becoming huge.  We're making him a rock and roll star.  It was excellent, my friend.  It was very good.  As a matter of fact, before the hour is up, I think we could sneak a Stephen Lynch song  in.  Please kill a kitten. 
[24:00]
 No, that one's overplayed.  I think we're going to do the lullaby.  The lullaby song.  All right, cool.  All right.  All right, man.  Take it easy.  Thanks, man.  Yeah, we are encouraging all the bands out there to send in their Tuesday Night Hummer  Club theme songs.  Fashion show is getting good, man.  Really?  What are they showing?  Blond Jure.  I'm seeing Patch.  I'm seeing Nip.  Wait, wait.  This is great, man.  Hold on.  I got my laptop over here.  Come on.  What's the...  God, it's Vict...  Look at that. 
[24:30]
 Look, Rick.  Oh, is she hot?  It's victoriasecret.com.  Victoria's with a N.  Victoria's secret.com.  Hold on.  Hold on.  One more.  Man.  Now everyone else is jumping on it.  Now I'm not going to get through.  Probably, but...  Wow.  They're doing like quick clips of...  Wow.  They're doing like quick clips of these girls just in their little negliges.  Look at that one, Rick.  Come on, come on, come on.  Look at that one, Rick.  Come on, come on, come on.  Just lop her head off.  She's ugly.  You're a mess.  Come on.  What's the matter?  Dude, you don't even know if you have Real Player Plus loaded in on that laptop. 
[25:00]
 I'll find out in a second.  That you're bragging about.  I'm not bragging about it.  Opie, it's so cute.  He's got a little...  Oh, look at that with the...  No, I got a real laptop over here.  Yeah, he's got a laptop, but you don't know it's loaded on it.  You didn't load anything.  Have some pride, man.  Hook up your laptop.  Update to the newest possible software.  What do you got on there?  Pong for Windows?  No, man.  I got a T1 and I don't know if I have Real Player.  I'll figure it out in a second here.  It's taking forever to load this.  Look at you.  This stinks.  That's good.  He's flying at 50 megahertz.  Oh, shut up.  You ass.  Anthony, what the piss was? 
[25:30]
 Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  We've got to take a break here.  You see if you can hook up with that, Opie.  Why does it say document done?  I don't know.  Oh, right here.  Has the bird chiseled the picture yet, like in the Flintstones?  I'm such an ass.  Hey, hey, Bon.  Look at this picture. 
[26:00]
 Oh, that was a good one.  All right.  We're over here looking at girls in lingerie and Opie's looking at error messages pinging  up on his screen.  Bing, bing.  It's not happening.  All right.  Oh, wait.  I do got real player.  But what version?  Um, doesn't say.  Oh, shoot.  Unable to locate server.  Oh, look at you.  I'm screwed.  Will everyone else have fun at Victoria's? 
[26:30]
 We'll help you out.  All right, Anthony, the Vermont Teddy Bear Company.  Valentine's Day coming up.  Yes.  You better be ready, guys.  What are you going to do?  get that bouquet of roses or something like you did last year or the chocolate, you know,  the girls look at that.  They see unoriginality.  They see that you don't care.  Well, not necessarily.  Yes, they do.  Girls don't want to see that year after year after year.  Something different, something new, something they'll love Vermont Teddy Bear.  All right.  And we only got 11 days left.  So I think it's time to get on the phone and take care of this. 
[27:00]
 It only takes they told us what five minutes you call 1-800-829-BEAR.  And within five minutes, you could take care of your whole Valentine's Day nightmare.  That's right.  They have a bear counselor.  You talk to them about what your girl likes, you know, what she's into hobbies, maybe job  and they could get a bear that fits her her little life.  Exactly.  It'll be very personal and she will love you for it.  She'll look at you like, oh, my God, he actually thought this out this time. 
[27:30]
 Yes.  And it's so simple. 
[28:00]
 Yeah, it's in a little teddy.  The Cupid bear and the horny little devil bear.  So give them a call.  Definitely.  If you've never given them Vermont Teddy Bear, this could be your year.  Girls love this.  Send it to them at work.  I was going to say a little hint, guys.  Send it to work because then they bragged to all the people they work with and you put  it on their desk or in their cubicle.  You're a hero.  Totally.  So give Vermont Teddy Bear a call.  It's 1-800-829-BEAR. 
[28:30]
 That's 1-800-829-BEAR.  Or if you're online right now, you can check out their website, www.vermontteddybear.com.  So P and Anthony, usually we have another commercial there.  So we can do that.  So we could segue back into our DJ style here.  A little transition.  All five.  All right.  We got I think we got the story of the day next.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The Rock of New York, 1027WNEW, Goo Goo Dolls, slide from Dizzy Up the Girl and Zeppelin 
[29:00]
 before that.  Good afternoon.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Anthony, a little distracted.  He's checking out the Victoria's Secret dot com website right now.  Well, now I got it running on top of like inset my browser there so I can go about my  other business and take a little peek at it on the computer and it's it's still right  up there.  Yeah.  Someone called and said they're showing it on the Jumbo Tron in Times Square.  Is that true?  Yeah, I guess they flashed it up there.  Nice.  I want to I want to be on that someday.  I was doing something really stupid. 
[29:30]
 It's got to be for the right thing.  You don't want to be up there as you know, convicted felon.  You think you think we could tap into that?  Hack in?  Yeah.  Has anyone ever hacked to the Jumbo Tron?  I don't know.  Is that possible?  God, that would be funny, wouldn't it?  That'd be huge.  Put some hardcore smut up there.  That's something that would really.  Just a message from Opie and Anthony.  Spin some heads.  Now saying hi to all the members of the Tuesday Night Humber Club or something.  Yeah.  Something to look into.  We could try.  A little felony.  Cheese Man from Queens writes this message is to Anthony. 
[30:00]
 Oh, oh, oh.  You got me into Half Life and now I'm in hot water with my wife.  And close with the territory.  Also the only time I can play is when she's in bed.  And who could play at midnight when you got to get up at six for work?  Later frag master.  Yeah.  That's Anthony's little name when you're playing Half Life multiplayer, right?  Yes, of course.  Ah, this poor guy.  I understand.  I got into Half Life and my marriage started to suffer.  Jen got extremely upset. 
[30:30]
 Now at first was she into it?  Yeah, you know, she was thinking, like, look over because the computer, she's got to turn  her head a little to see me on it.  And yeah, she was like, well, that's pretty interesting.  Because Sandy's still into the I'm into it phase.  Really?  With me and Tomb Raider 3.  Yeah, that'll go away.  But I'm having a feeling that, yeah, that's going to change eventually.  Yeah, yeah.  When you're not spending a lot of time, you know, on the couch watching TV with them,  they get upset.  And that's the way it went. 
[31:00]
 I mean, for hours on end, I'd get home.  What time do we usually get home?  8.30, quarter to nine.  Yeah, 8.30, quarter to nine.  And you know, three in the morning, four in the morning, I'm trotting up to bed.  And I had been on the computer the entire time.  A couple of times, no problem.  But day after day after day, she got pissed.  I had to just like a junkie, like an addict, pull myself away, cold turkey, and try to  do it just every other day. 
[31:30]
 So now there are certain days I go home and I sit on the couch and watch TV with my wife.  Now, how bad are you jonesing to turn on the computer as you sit there with your wife watching  TV?  Well, I do get a little shaky sometimes.  I look over at the computer and it's right there.  It's so close.  It's like if you're a smoker, right?  And you're smoking and you try to quit.  And the butts, the pack is right on the table.  It's within arm's reach.  What do you do?  What do you do?  So I've tried and I've been doing much better. 
[32:00]
 I did have a, what do they call that?  A relapse.  A relapse.  A little relapse, you fell off the wagon?  I fell off the wagon last week.  I came home and as Jen tells me, I screwed up the story yesterday.  I said that I come home and she has candles lit all over the place, a fire in the fireplace.  That's a sign.  She's wearing her little PJs.  That's a sign.  She cooked a wonderful dinner for me and I went right to the computer. 
[32:30]
 She goes, you failed to mention you did this two nights in a row.  You didn't catch the signal twice, two nights in a row?  No, no, I'll see.  So the second night she systematically blew out all the candles, looking at me in between  each one.  And then the next day took all the candlesticks, because she is so into candles.  The place looks like some kind of gothic castle and packed them all away. 
[33:00]
 She packed them like, you know something, I tried but now no candles ever, ever, ever.  She was fuming, so I definitely had to apologize for that one.  Then the candles came out and I came home the other night and the candles lit again.  What did I do?  You knew what to do.  I didn't even look at the computer.  Not even a fleeting glance.  There you go.  And then you had some of that retard sex that you discovered.  Did you get in trouble for that too yesterday? 
[33:30]
 I said that me and my wife had retard sex because we were just making grunts and drooling.  Yeah.  Your mom is listening to this Anthony.  Twice in the morning.  Really?  Pretty good, yeah.  Like how lions and tigers do it.  And it's done and then you roll over and just grunt.  And then like ten minutes later up again, grunt, grunt, grunt. 
[34:00]
 That's retard sex.  Okay.  My definition anyway.  We're still trying to get the perfect definition of retard sex.  We're getting great ones on the instant feedback but we just can't read them.  No.  So, Cheese Man from Queens.  I don't know what to tell you.  You got to play when you can.  You got to get in there.  Like if midnight is the only time you can play, what can I tell you?  Have fun.  I'll see you out in the battlefield.  Well, we were discussing this on the way in today. 
[34:30]
 What happened to the games that you just played and you could shoot through a bunch of levels  in an hour?  Oh no.  All these games that come out nowadays, you're guaranteed if you're going to see it all the  way to the end to play for a couple months.  Very complicated, Opie.  Like you're on to a new game.  Well, I was playing, I got to talk about this other one too.  Wargasm?  I'm controlling an army.  I don't know.  I'm in a battlefield.  I'm flying helicopters. 
[35:00]
 I'm bombing things.  I don't even know what I'm doing.  I have not a clue, but it's great.  I mean I get to wipe out thousands of people.  And then Gangster.  I'm playing that where I'm a Don.  I am a Godfather and I have to get these lieutenants and cronies underneath them and try to extort  money from the locals.  I keep getting whacked within the first ten minutes.  So you're still just trying to figure out what that's all about.  It used to be so easy with like Mario Brothers. 
[35:30]
 Yeah.  That was it.  Now it takes you months to just figure this stuff out.  Do you remember the noise when you lost in Mario Brothers?  Wait, wait, where is it?  Oh, wait, no, that was, that was Pac-Man.  Yeah.  That was Mario Brothers.  Was it?  I think so.  I think it was. 
[36:00]
 Hi, NW.  Hello.  Hello.  Hi, what's up?  I was listening to the show, Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  And my husband is the same way.  He can wake up at six or six thirty and he's on that computer.  Oh, causing trouble.  Before he goes to bed, he's on the computer.  It's like I'm invisible.  What is he doing on there?  Anything online, online banking.  Oh, no, he's not banking.  See, that's dangerous. 
[36:30]
 At least I'm playing the games.  He's not banking.  If he's on the computer, I can't give that one away to the ladies.  Oh, all right.  We ought to do this one day.  Is this computer right there?  Yeah, it's not on, no, he's not here.  Do you know how to turn it on?  Yeah.  Yeah, turn it on.  Go ahead.  Okay.  We're going to go into the history file and see where he's been.  No, I can't do that.  Come on.  You're a rat, Anthony. 
[37:00]
 Come on.  This is always fun.  You're a rat.  Let's see what's in his history file.  Sucksluts.com.  Yeah, that's no banking website.  Yeah, banking.  He's banking, all right.  All right, if you don't want to rat him out.  All right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you either.  I guess you got to give him hell like my wife gave me.  You got to smack him back to his senses.  So you just have to get noticed and put on a sexy negligee or something. 
[37:30]
 Well, I don't know if that'll work for you, but you ought to give it a try.  What are you saying about this lovely lady, Anthony?  I was thinking about joining the Hummer Club.  Well, that would be a start.  Is this Juliette Lewis from that movie, The Other Sister?  Cut it out of it.  Poor ladies calling us with a problem and look at you.  Could you say something for me, honey?  Yes.  Could you say, I want a corn dog?  I want a corn dog.  Well, that was a little test. 
[38:00]
 Sounded a little weird at first.  Yeah, the Hummer thing could work.  I know if I was getting a Hummer every night, I would never go on my computer.  Yes, yes, you would.  I don't think so.  Right after.  After?  Probably in between.  Like right when the Hummer is done, all you'd be thinking is,  I sure would like to get through that next level.  Well, yeah, then I would.  Yeah, that's true.  Well, good luck to you. 
[38:30]
 Okay, thank you.  All right. Bye.  I'm sorry, I thought you had a little...  That guy's not doing banking late at night while she sleeps and banking.  No way.  Doing the banking, honey.  Very important to do the banking.  He has found some fine chat rooms.  So I'm 14 too.  Oh, God.  That's great.  No, oh, wow, you're into field hockey, so am I.  Yeah, you're a dirty girl. 
[39:00]
 My teacher sucks too.  I'm doing the banking, dear.  You stay in bed.  You ought to go the distance.  Why?  I thought we were all having fun.  You could have just said, yeah, I'm in college too.  But no, no, I'm in fourth grade.  Great.  That's cute.  All right, we still got the Stephen Lynch song on the way that we promised you guys.  And I think this is the story of the day.  Anthony, the train from Jersey says it all.  He says, guys, you are killing me.  Don't give away the history file access. 
[39:30]
 You'll ruin it for all online banking married men.  Hey, all I'm saying, guys, is clear your damn files out of there.  If you're going to be visiting those sites, you'd be a damn well better clear your files, your history, your cash.  Clear it out.  Your 10th folder.  Anthony, you almost hung out a guy to dry when that lady just called.  I gave him a reprieve and he should be thankful and take that opportunity now to dump his files. 
[40:00]
 She wanted to know what the guy's doing late at night on the computer while she's sleeping.  And he's told her that, you know, he's doing banking on the computer late at night.  And Anthony goes, why don't you check out her, you know, the history files of his computer and guys go to like windows dot com and get yourself a good shredder program.  You dump all your files through there and delete them that way because just deleting them doesn't delete doesn't do the job.  No, the rock of New York, one or two seven W.N.E.W.  Screw the music. 
[40:30]
 We got something to talk about here real fast.  It's open Anthony and you never know who's going to step on by the studio.  This beautiful woman decided to come by the N.E.W. studios.  Now, what's your name?  Tara.  Hi, Tara.  Tara. This is by far the cutest girl we've had in here so far.  Like when we have girls that come in and they get naked or something or they're in for something.  Yeah.  And we're like, yeah, they're hot.  Well, Tara, usually not.  But Tara, that's not saying much because we had like a skank crack whore that got naked. 
[41:00]
 And she put Christmas lights all over her body and then she beat up Anthony.  And then we had a girl whose ass was so big that she had to walk through that door sideways.  My ass is not big.  No, there's nothing big.  Well, there's one thing.  There's one thing too.  Now, you called us up about 10 minutes ago.  We didn't think you were going to show up.  Now, what's the deal?  You've been in the city all day.  I've been in the city all day.  And what happened was over this past weekend at the Super Bowl, which by the way, I also called you guys because I was going to. 
[41:30]
 Never mind.  It's a different story.  But anyway, this weekend, my aunt, her brother-in-law just became the president of Playboy.  So, like, you know, I had made composite cards up like over the course of like the summer and I had everything going.  I was all psyched.  And then I sent a bunch of letters out to modeling agencies and they sent them all back.  They're like, no, you're not what we're looking for.  You're not what we're looking for.  I'm like, what are they looking for?  What are you looking for then?  You know, and it pretty much is what they're looking for is a six foot, no chest, no butt, like clone. 
[42:00]
 And then that's not what women look like.  You know what I mean?  And I mean, I think I'm all right.  You know what I mean?  I can hold my own.  Well, yeah.  No problem with it.  Bravo.  Now, how tall are you?  How tall are you?  I'm five, six and a half.  Five, six and a half.  OK.  I'm a 36C.  Yes, I see that.  I have 26 ways.  Yes, I see that.  34 hips.  You know, I have nice long legs.  I can dance.  I can practice.  I can do anything you want.  I have blonde hair.  You know? 
[42:30]
 What color eyes?  Brown.  Sometimes they turn green.  That's OK.  It depends on what kind of mood I'm in.  There you go.  That's all right.  And I don't know.  I just figured I'd call you guys and ask if you could maybe help me out or, you know, just  check me out.  Well, I think we could have our own Victoria's Secret modeling show because I think a lot  of people having a tough time getting on the Victoria's Secret website.  Yeah, they have their little website thing going on right now.  It's some kind of fashion show and stuff.  And it's really hyped and everything.  And it's hard to get on the site.  We were trying and I got on for a little while, but then I forget about it.  What we could do is we could take some digital pictures of you and we could put it up on 
[43:00]
 our website and we could have the listener decide if you're worthy of becoming a model  or not.  Yeah.  And maybe some of the model agencies are listening and they could pop on the website and get  a quick picture of you and see what you're all about.  That'd be good.  Are we just doing my face?  What are we doing?  Whatever you want to do.  Believe me, knowing us and our listeners, they probably want to see more than you.  So why don't we take a listener and see what they want to see?  Well, I already know what you want to see. 
[43:30]
 We don't even have to go to the phone.  I think we could speak for the listeners at this point.  I think we could cover all bases.  We get a nice face shot, full body shot.  Well, since I've been around all day, I've been wearing this shirt.  I don't have a bra on, but I do have underwear on.  So if you want me to throw a bra on to do like a...  I guess not then, huh?  No bra.  That would be great.  Well, now you were looking to get into Playboy.  Is that it?  You wanted to...  You know, I really wanted to be on Playboy.  I called about it, you know, like I said, over the summer.  I was real like, go get it.  Did you send some shots over there, Tom? 
[44:00]
 Well, what I did was, since my aunt, her brother-in-law is the president of Playboy...  Yeah, that's an in.  I know.  I was like...  She blew me out of the water, man.  Like, all day, my wheels are going, the smoke's coming out of my ears.  And so what I did was I gave her a face shot of me, you know, just so she's like, just  so she knows I'm not trying to pass a puppy on him, you know?  And then she's like, you know, just give me your measurements and stuff.  So I'm waiting to hear from her either today or tomorrow to see maybe if you could do something  for me.  If you can't, then I'll do it on my own.  Right on.  But I'm aggravated because, you know, once I do get big and I want to have a good attitude 
[44:30]
 about it, I'm not cocky.  I just want to have a good attitude about it and say that, you know, when I do get up  there, all these people that like gave me like, you know, all the crap in the world,  I just want to give them a big F-U on your show, huh?  There you go.  That's what Anthony and I do every day.  There's a lot of people that, you know, are trying to talk us out of our dreams, man.  So...  All right.  I'm happy to take some shots of you, put it up on the web and let the people speak  and believe me, I know what they're going to say.  Yeah, I know. 
[45:00]
 Now, Tara's 21.  I got to warn you, the listeners can be a little brutal.  Okay, that's all right.  One girl that came down and did this a few months ago, she did leave crying.  But she wasn't as hot as she is now.  It can't be as bad as Ralph the...  What, over on Howard?  On Howard's show?  Yeah.  He should talk too, that bastard.  Can I tell the story?  Yeah.  We went to the dysfunctional family picnic, I don't know if it was over this past summer,  and like they were all there.  And you know, he's so brutal, but you know, I was standing by like where the DJ setup 
[45:30]
 was, and he was checking me out.  So like, you know, I'm thinking maybe I should go and get evaluated and be like, you know,  hey, don't talk to me like that because you were checking me out.  He was looking me up and down a few times.  We let the listeners do the evaluating on this show.  See, that's good.  Yeah, see?  You can get a little added touch over there.  Yeah.  You know?  And they're really hard because...  Yeah.  Well, the listeners, what's cool is you get a whole cross section of a bunch of different 
[46:00]
 guys out there.  Yeah, that's cool.  And you know what I mean?  Like I said, I don't think what I think is what a man wants is a little meat.  Right.  You know what I mean?  All right, screw the talking.  We need to start...  All right.  Now, Rick and Ben, you've got to get the lighting just right for...  Yeah, you guys.  I think I need to turn some lights around.  You've got to get the lighting just right for...  All right.  You can take the headphones off.  Okay.  Now, what do you want to start with?  I think we need a very lovely face shot.  A lovely face shot.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  Wow.  I like that.  Out of my face. 
[46:30]
 Digital camera.  Okay, Anthony.  Give us a smile.  Yeah.  Wow.  Closer.  All right, take another one.  I think I got my nostril.  Take another one.  You keep laughing just before he takes the picture.  Yeah.  Just give him a nice pose.  Give me a sultry shot.  There you go.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's really good.  I got a tingle.  I know you did.  I was tingling.  I saw that.  All right.  Now, we need a full body shot.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[47:00]
 Okay.  Let's stand up.  All right.  Move that chair out of there, Rick.  All right.  Wait.  Is the lighting right, you think?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Stand right there.  I know what I'm doing.  Perfect.  I like the whole idea.  It's obvious you know what you're doing.  My God.  Okay.  Let me back up a little.  Sorry.  All right.  I'm drooling.  Let's get it.  I'm thinking about having retarded sex right now.  Sorry.  Wow.  We speak our minds.  That's okay.  Can we do the sultry look?  Yeah. 
[47:30]
 Do the full body sultry look.  Great.  Turn on the air conditioning in the studio.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Is that good?  Wow.  All right.  How about a little of the...  Yeah.  You want to turn around a little bit.  Well, you want to get the over the...  Whoa.  Yeah.  Penthouse pose.  That's...  Oh, wow.  Nice butt.  Holy...  That's mean.  Man, you almost cursed.  Relax.  I was like, oh, jeez.  All right.  Do you got enough body shots, I think, of that? 
[48:00]
 Yeah.  Well, yeah.  I think.  Unless you want to pose her in a different fashion.  Well, we're going to go for the full Monty now.  A little...  We could have some of the guys leave if you want.  These guys are never around when we're doing boring political radio.  And Ben the fag doesn't care about girls.  Yeah.  I won't worry about that.  All right.  All right.  This is going to be for the Playboy shot.  Yeah.  The Playboy shot.  Yeah.  And we should lower the lighting.  All right.  Fix the lighting for her.  She's got to feel comfortable. 
[48:30]
 Okay.  You know what else I need?  What else do you need?  Whatever you need.  You need water?  Water.  Oh.  Get the girl some water, for God's sake.  Wow.  She's good.  Very attractive.  I like that.  Ben obviously isn't a fag because he was the first to get to the water fountain.  Yeah.  You can strip down while we're waiting for the water.  We won't mind whatsoever.  Not at all.  All right.  Ben's got the water.  Ben's got the water.  Good boy, Ben.  Ben the fag, everyone.  All right.  She's taking all her clothes off.  Taking the big boots off.  All right.  All right. 
[49:00]
 All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  The big boots off.  That's good.  I like those with the heel.  Oh, a little ankle tack.  Oh, God.  Wow.  Twenty-one, Terry.  Beautiful.  And who wrote she smells good?  Oh, my God.  Smell good?  Wow.  Would you look at the ass on this girl.  All right.  Now, wait.  Just like that, how about that ass shot you gave us before? 
[49:30]
 Well, yeah.  You need a couple pictures.  Well, now turn around.  Look at me.  One of those where you show your ass and you're looking around.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  There it is.  Oh, my God.  Is that a good one?  That's perfect.  You guys are going to love this.  This is good.  This is great.  Okay.  Now a front one with the sultry look.  The Rock of New York 1027WNEW Harvey Danger and Flagpole Sidi.  It's Opie and Anthony and the lovely and talented Tara.  Still in the studio. 
[50:00]
 Anthony is attempting to put all the photographs he just took on the website.  Very, very busy over here.  I'm hacking away.  How many more minutes you think you need because the instant feedback is going nuts.  Oh, wow.  That's a good one.  Yeah, that is a good picture.  The guys are going to like that one.  Yeah.  Come take a look at this.  Wait a minute.  Can you flip that one?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Look at that.  That's the best one right there.  Wow.  That's a hot picture.  Wow.  Oh, you see a little ankle tattoo in there too. 
[50:30]
 Very cute.  All right.  What do you need?  Another 10 minutes, you think?  Well, it might take me quite a while.  Yeah, yeah.  Just give me time.  Don't worry.  I'll get it off there.  Because these guys are just freaking.  I don't doubt it.  And a few women are freaking.  They're like, come on, where are the photographs?  Really?  Look at that.  If you're just tuning in, Tara calls.  She's been going to modeling agencies all day long.  Right?  Yeah, I've been going.  And you've just been...  Well, a lot of them are just saying you're not tall enough.  I mean, they're really not saying you're not pretty enough, but you know.  Tall enough.  Well, you're 5'6", so you're tall enough.  Yeah, I'm not tall enough.  I'm not tall enough.  I'm not tall enough.  I'm not tall enough.  I'm not tall enough.  I'm not tall enough. 
[51:00]
 I'm not tall enough.  You know, I carry myself well, I think.  Yeah, certainly do.  We had a nice face.  Wow, beautiful face.  Thank you.  Rachel Hunter-ish.  Ish.  Not, no, because you have your own.  Oh, back in her hay day.  Back in her hay day, right.  Maybe, yeah.  A little bit.  I should have got the...  No, she looks like someone else though.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I mean, she looks like someone else.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  No, she looks like someone else though.  She looks like Juliette Lewis's real hot sister.  No, no. 
[51:30]
 We'll let the listeners decide when the pictures are up.  She's got her own look.  Very cute.  Be nice.  So this is...  So the deal is they don't have a choice.  And she took a bunch of pictures of her in all sorts of undress.  Yeah.  Full dress.  No dress.  And now the listeners are going to tell you what they think of you.  And they could be brutal.  All right.  I can't see them being that brutal though.  I swear to God.  Yeah, I'd be surprised if the comments come in, they're really bad. 
[52:00]
 You know, guys just being a-holes I think.  I'm not trying to say I'm perfect, but you know what I mean?  You work all that out.  When you get into a studio, you do lighting, you do the makeup.  You know what I mean?  It all helps.  Not that I...  What's your dream to be in Playboy, you think?  I want to be in Playboy.  That's definitely my dream.  But I would like to sing.  What if like Swank called or something?  Swank?  Swank?  I want to be picked as classy.  Now, okay, there's Playboy, there's Penthouse, would you go for Penthouse?  Well, what do the Penthouse pets do?  I mean, do they like touch themselves?  Sometimes they're a bit provocative, yes.  Penthouse is just a stage below Playboy.  You wouldn't go in Biggums or anything, right? 
[52:30]
 No.  Or Hustler or anything like that.  No, no, no.  Definitely not.  Biggums.  Definitely not.  No, no, no.  I would like to sing.  I would like to sing.  I would like to sing.  I would like to sing.  I would like to sing.  I would like to sing.  I would like to sing.  I would like to sing.  I would like to sing.  I would like to sing.  I would like to sing.

 I would like to sing.  I would like to sing.  I would like to sing.  I would like to sing.  I would like to sing.  I would like to sing.  I would like to sing.  I would like to sing.  All right, Anthony, the listeners are freaking out.  How much more time do you need?  What's that?  I can't hold them back anymore on the instant feedback.  I'm working on it.  As fast as you can?  As fast as I possibly can.  All right, you'll have the photos of Tower up and running soon.  Yes.  1027 WNEW, the Rock in New York, with Everlast, What It's Like from Whitey Ford, Sings the  Blues. 
[54:30]
 It's Ophie and Anthony, and Tower's still in the studio.  And you bastards have made this show come to a complete halt.  I am so trying to upload these pictures of Tower, but I can't even get on it to upload.  I mean, you people are just pounding this site.  We told you, please wait.  Guys, wait.  I don't even know.  She wants her pictures on the website.  Come on, just give them like five more minutes. 
[55:00]
 Everybody get off.  Honestly, we need just a couple hundred people right now to get off the NW website.  I think we could do it right now as we're on the air.  Someone's got to sacrifice right now.  I'll sing live every night.  Well, eventually we'll have Tower's pictures up.  I'm trying.  You bastards are clogging the...  I need to say that.  ...the system right now.  You're clogging it.  Sacrifice it for the team, guys.  Someone's got to sign off the website right now. 
[55:30]
 Let me see that picture.  Yeah, let's take a look.  Look at that.  It's in here.  Oh, yeah.  Anthony's just taking a look at one of her pictures.  Did you see the first one?  Yeah, that's good.  Nice.  All right.  Well, I'm trying.  I know.  I know you're trying it desperately.  I know.  We need our listeners to come through.  But it's giving me this thing like it wants to connect.  All right.  All right. 
[56:00]
 I might be onto something.  Oh, connection failed.  Thank you.  Ah, too many people still on the site.  Get off.  We're going to catch 22 right now.  Someone's got to take it for the team and log off the website.  It'll happen.  It might happen like at midnight tonight at this point.  We want you guys to get, you know, to send in your comments.  We have to see the pictures, but we only have an hour left in the show.  Yeah, look at that.  All right.  Do you want to get to the story?  I don't know.  Look at this, huh?  Well, it's the story of the day. 
[56:30]
 It really is.  Screw the impeachment hearings and all that crap.  Who cares if Walter Payton needs a liver?  This is a good news story right here.  It was in Newsday.  It was all over the news yesterday.  Make room for daddy.  Yoshiko, the chimpanzee, cradles her newborn daughter, Toshi.  Hey.  At the Los Angeles Zoo Monday.  So this chimpanzee has this baby.  Yoshiko, but they call her Yoshi. 
[57:00]
 Yoshi the chimpanzee.  Hey.  Yoshi the chimpanzee.  Eat.  Poop.  Well, Yoshi gave birth Sunday to this chimpanzee, but that was a surprise to everyone at the  zoo because you see all the chimpanzees at the zoo were vasectomized.  Yeah, they had vasectomies and like one of them was too old and not interested in sex.  Yeah.  So they're trying to figure out who got Yoshi the chimp pregnant. 
[57:30]
 Yoshi the chimp.  Yoshi the chimp.  Hey.  Yoshi the chimp man.  I ride my unicycle in the circus.  Or.  I don't know.  Can there be this cross breeding maybe?  What do you mean by that?  Whoa.  Look who's coming through the door.  All right.  Damn you all.  Damn you.  Okay.  It was me. 
[58:00]
 Mr. Hassen, it was you.  I went into the zoo and had sex with Yoshi the chimpanzee.  Damn me to hell.  I couldn't help it.  After spending time on the Planet of the Apes, I grew accustomed to that.  Red chimpanzee ass.  You ever made love to a chimpanzee?  No, I can't say I have.  Nothing like it.  Once you go chimp, you never go back. 
[58:30]
 That supple red ass.  Yearning.  I went to the zoo.  Yoshi spun around and faced that red ass at me.  It was yearning.  Calling me.  As was the burning bush when I played Moses.  Saying, take this, thine red ass upon thee.  Make love to my red chimpanzee ass. 
[59:00]
 I must admit, I ate monkey meat.  Damn me to hell.  I ate monkey meat at the zoo.  Now, Mr. Hassen.  Yes.  Why would you be attracted to a chimpanzee when you had Nova?  Nova.  Yes, she was quite a babe in her loincloth.  But she just didn't have enough bodily hair. 
[59:30]
 When Zira seduced me in that little cave thing they lived in,  then I did have a threesome with Zira and Cornelius.  I admit it.  I ate monkey meat.  I tasted the forbidden fruit of the monkey's red ass.  I couldn't resist.  I visited the zoo and saw Yoshi.  Little Yoshi and that red ass.  My God, forgive me. 
[60:00]
 Lord God, please forgive me for partaking in the forbidden meat of monkey.  Damn me to hell.  Now, Mr. Hassen, there's a lovely picture of your girlfriend in Newsday.  Look at the cans on Yoshi.  My God, that's the luckiest baby jimp I've ever seen.  Getting snuggled against the bosom of that hairy ape. 
[60:30]
 Damn, I love that monkey.  Yeah, all right.  I'll be making more visits to more zoos.  There might be a population explosion of Charlton chimps.  A new breed, the Charlton chimp.  That's right, it wears a toupee and has a red ass.  Is it true also that you were Caesar's father?  Damn.  Damn, you found me out.  All right, from my sexploits with Zira. 
[61:00]
 Yeah, okay.  It was me.  Well, we got the explanation to the chimp getting pregnant at the LA Zoo.  Well, thank you, Mr. Hassen.  That's great.  I'm so embarrassed.  Can you take your little cherry and get out of the studio?  We've got a show to do.  Where's my music?  Oh, you want to?  Yeah, yeah.  Off horse.  Yeah.  Play my music, damn you.  All right, I'll play your music.  Damn you to hell.  Now, get the hell out of here.  When are you putting those pictures up on the website?  Damn you.  Damn you all to hell.  There he goes, everyone.  Charlton Hassen.  Wow.  So it was Chuck Hassen that fathered that chimp baby. 
[61:30]
 Yeah, that's what we're getting at there.  Hi.  Exclusive.  N.E.W.  O.B.  Nancy.  What's up?  Hey, Mr. Hassen, once you go chimp, you never go limp.  You know what I'm saying?  That's what I'm saying.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp. 
[62:00]
 I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp. 
[62:30]
 I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  I'm going to go chimp.  God, thank you for Pricelife.  We love Pricelife.  Mr. Heston, I thought you left.  I was leaving, but I had to come back and talk about Pricelife.  What a fabulous service this is.  If only I had this on the Planet of the Apes.  I could have gotten a hotel room instead of staying at Jira's and Cornelius's. 
[63:00]
 Do they even have hotels in Planet of the Apes?  Yes, they're those big pottery-looking things.  I see.  But Priceline could have gotten me a cheaper rate.  Yes, they could have.  Yes.  You know what I had to pay for that room?  How much?  My friend's brain.  They cut out his brain.  Priceline, maybe he could have just had to spend a foot or a hand, not a whole brain.  You cut out his brain. 
[63:30]
 My brain!  Damn baboon!  Hey, Mr. Heston, were you smoking some of the wacky weed before the show today?  I have no comment on such things.  Okay.  That would defy the laws of God.  Well, Pricelife.com, we love these guys.  Pricelife.  If you're looking for a hotel room in the near future, looking to have some of that retard sex,  or get some monkey meat.  Monkey meat. 
[64:00]
 And you need a place.  A free night at a hotel with Priceline to dine on monkey meat.  Well, you get the free hotel room if you use their service.  That's right, Mr. Heston.  Who wouldn't use this service?  It's fabulous.  And this is where you name your own price for a hotel room, and then Priceline matches that for you.  I could take Nova.  She would love a night at a hotel.  I could wash her up.  She's getting a little gamey.  I was going to say that.  Now, I mean, you haven't held up over the years.  You're starting to look like a monkey at this point, Mr. Heston. 
[64:30]
 God, I look like Dr. Zayas.  You sure do.  Look at me.  Now, did Nova hold up?  No, I ditched her.  You did?  Yes, she's getting a little old.  A little raggy.  Around the edges.  I need some fresh monkey meat.  All right, so if you're looking for a hotel room in the near future, give our pals at Priceline.com a try.  I think you'll be happy with their service.  Priceline, the service sent from Lord God himself.  1027 WNAW, the Rock of New York, Black Crows from By Your Side. 
[65:00]
 Ticking my heart around, and NAW presents the Crows at the Beacon on the 25th, 27th, and 28th of this month.  We'll see you there.  It's OP and Anthony, and the lovely Tara still hanging with us in the studio here.  Hello.  And we've got to hand it to you guys out there in Radioland.  Yeah, yeah.  I guess we just found out that we have a lot of listeners to our radio show, Anthony.  I guess so.  Because we're getting reports from the tech department here at NAW that Tara, you have pretty much crashed our system here at NAW. 
[65:30]
 And he said it's a bigger problem.  Like, it could be like a Northeast problem.  Like, this totally... everyone's going to be mad at us because they're not going to be able to get online because of us and Tara.  This totally like did something to the Internet. 
[66:00]
 We set the Internet back like 20 years because everyone wants to see Tara's pictures.  And the email's going nuts.  There's an email somewhere here from a precinct that says, the police department from Del Bronx.  And they say, OP and Anthony, hurry up.  The guys decided to stop fighting crime.  They want to see what Tara looks like.  So they're all like hunched around a computer hoping to see the pictures.  Yeah. There you go.  Now, if you're just tuning in, I guess we've got to go back a little bit. 
[66:30]
 Tara came into the city today and she's trying to become a model.  Her legitimate pictures are really, really nice.  And you're beautiful in person.  So Anthony and I took some pictures of you.  We wanted to put them on the NAW website because we like to share with our audience.  Yes.  When we see something really cool in the studio, it's one thing to sit in your car and wonder,  what the heck are the jocks seeing?  I want to see that.  And most DJs don't give you that chance.  We do.  That's why we wanted to put the pictures on the website so everyone else could take a peek.  Yeah, we wanted to.  And then we were going to have the listeners comment if you were like Playboy material because you want to be in Playboy. 
[67:00]
 Yes, I do.  But everyone freaked out and they were trying to get on our NAW website  and pretty much the system is f'ed up.  Yeah, something just snapped.  And we can't get anything.  Hi, NAW.  Hey, I'll be Joe Beck.  Joe Big Butt, how are you doing?  Hey, Joe, what's up?  I just read the email.  I wanted to go through it.  I recognize the site.  I know.  I don't know what's going on. 
[67:30]
 Listen, it's not fair.  I get the biggest spot in the Tri-State area, if not the world, to sit on my head.  The whole world sees it and I can't see her in the studio.  A beautiful woman.  Yeah, she's gorgeous.  Not fair.  What do we have to go fight the public?  Now, Joe was the one that we had Mendy from Big Butt magazine sit on his face.  Oh, God, that was disgusting.  For what tickets?  The Pearl Jam tickets?  The Pearl Jam, 10th row.  Yeah, the Pearl Jam tickets.  Let me just really make you go wild here, Joe.  It would take 10 of Tara to balance out a seesaw with Mendy.  Well, I didn't see his ground. 
[68:00]
 No, I mean, Mendy's cool on her own, right?  She loves having a huge mama butt.  Joe, were you into Mendy's butt?  Oh, no, she was on top of me.  No, not really, no.  I had a lot of fun, though.  I did have a lot of fun.  No, I'd much rather be there now.  And Joe's been with us since the beginning.  Absolutely.  Thank you, Joe.  Absolutely.  You guys are great.  Yes, thank you, Joe.  All right, Joe.  All right, Joe.  We're working on it.  We're working on it.  Thank you.  Yeah, so that's the deal. 
[68:30]
 Simple as that.  Are we going to do like a part two type thing?  I guess we have to.  They completely screwed up the Internet.  I've never seen this before.  I can't even get instant feedback.  Nothing.  Nothing's working.  Nothing is working because simple as this, something got crashed.  Yeah.  And Scott Colombo saying it's a bigger problem now, too.  Yeah, like wiped out the Northeast or something.  Geez.  Can you believe this?  Well, the Tower is beautiful.  Thank you. 
[69:00]
 I guess eventually the pictures will be on the W&W website.  Eventually.  Yes.  But it's, I don't know.  I don't know if it's going to happen before seven.  I am so working here.  I know you are.  I really am.  It brought our show to a complete halt.  Yeah, it really did.  We could take a couple more calls here.  Hi, any W. Any W.  Hey, what's the deal, dude?  What's the deal?  What happened?  I think all the listeners pounded this site so bad that a bunch of servers crashed. 
[69:30]
 So that's it.  Pretty much.  It's not happening tonight.  For right now.  For right now.  Trust me, we are trying to take care of you guys.  I don't think any W is used to having hundreds of thousands of hits on their any W website.  Yeah, no doubt.  Before now, you went on the website to see an old picture of Scott Muni.  Who cares?  So I think they might have to update their software and hardware and all sorts of wares. 
[70:00]
 Underwear.  Underwear.  Underwear.  What else?  Are you guys keeping up, man?  We are.  All right, get it going.  Well, eventually you'll see Tara's pictures.  That's all I can say.  Is this going to happen today?  Maybe tomorrow?  If we knew, we'd tell you, man.  All right.  We are freaking.  We really want them up there.  I do get to get feedback.  All right, man.  Cool.  Yeah.  Tara wants your feedback too when you finally do see the pictures.  So make sure you send that in to us.  It'll probably be for tomorrow's show.  We'll have you on the phone.  Okay. 
[70:30]
 So you can hear what the listeners are saying.  Sounds good.  You guys will freak out.  Hi, NW.  Yo, I just called...  I'm right here.  What's up?  Go.  My Internet thing?  Yeah.  They blamed it on you.  Did they really?  I swear to God.  No.  Yeah, I think we caused some major, major Internet problems.  I apologize to everybody in the Northeast, but I think we just caused some major screw  up here.  What's your provider?  Some little crappy thing in my town. 
[71:00]
 And you called them up because you can't get online right now?  I was on your site.  Yeah.  It booted me off.  I was going to go back on.  Yeah.  Yahoo!  Any other site doesn't let me on.  Really?  Oh, and they blamed it on us?  And I wanted to see this girl.  Well, you will eventually.  Yeah.  We can guarantee that.  Midnight tonight?  Most likely.  I'll be checking back.  I'll call them all to give the results.  All right, thanks.  You guys are great.  Thank you.  Hi, NW.  Hello.  Hi, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I tried calling you guys.  In the beginning, you always got through. 
[71:30]
 I was the guy who said you grew on people like ear hair.  Yeah.  But now it's impossible to get through.  I'm sure the internet's got to be going crazy.  Yeah.  You mean to tell me hundreds of thousands of people never got through the deep scum unit?  No.  You know, the counter on the NW website before we got here was at 328.  328 hits.  And there's a good number of people who are listening to the station right now.  And they can hear some biscuit.  Yeah.  And I'm going to go to the other side.  I'm going to go to the other side.  I'm going to go to the other side.  I'm going to go to the other side.  I'm going to go to the other side.  I'm going to go to the other side.  I think that the Scop Muny siesta is quite enjoyable to listen to. 
[72:00]
 Did you say the siesta or the fiesta?  Siesta.  Yeah, that's what I was saying.  All right.  Take care, guys.  All right, man.  Bye-bye.  Hi, NW.  Hello.  Yeah.  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up? 
[72:30]
 What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  What's up?  Oh, you don't have a Florida jet?  I'm having trouble with you people.  Listen, I'm not going.  I'm waiting to go home.  I understand that.  I can't go home to my wife.  I've got to see this first.  That's a huge problem with the Internet right now. 
[73:00]
 The funny thing is Anthony is catching a lot of hell on the instant feedback that is coming  through.  One guy is like, what is Anthony typing with?  Boxing gloves?  Boxing gloves, yeah.  The other guy goes, hurry up.  My wife gets home in 20 minutes.  I've got to see the fixer.  My wife could call me any minute now and say, come on home.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we're doing the best we can.  We're working on it diligently.  Thank you.  We appreciate it.  All right, man.  Take care.  Bye. 
[73:30]
 Well, I don't know.  Let's take a break and yeah, let's see what's happening here because maybe a miracle will  happen.  Yeah, you never know.  The Rock of New York 1027 WNEW.  Collective sold their latest from Dosage.  Heavy and we got another WNEW world premiere broadcast of Collective Souls new album Dosage  tonight at 11 right here on your damn radio.  That's brought to you by Nissan Maxima.  So be it's Anthony and Tara decided to stick around for the last segment or two of our  show and Anthony, do you have good news for the faithful listeners of the open Anthony 
[74:00]
 show?  Well, I'll be judging by the instant feedback from Joe and Rocklin.  He says, thanks guys for the pics.  She looks good.  We got them up.  They are up finally.  My God.  It took an hour and a half.  Now this will probably crash the system when everyone tries to see them now, but at least  they're there.  Yeah.  And as long as Tara gives us the permission, we're going to keep them up for a few days.  Is that cool?  That's cool.  No problem.  All right. 
[74:30]
 If you weren't listening earlier, Tara came in, she's been trying to become a model and  she's had a lot of doors shut in her face because some say she's not tall enough.  She's her boobs are too big, blah, blah, blah.  You get that your boobs are too big.  Yeah, because they're looking for the weights.  Yeah, you're looking for the rails, you know, looking for like 107 pounds, six foot tall.  I'm not that and I won't ever be that.  That's not what women look like.  And she wants to be in Playboy.  So Anthony took some great photos, man.  Yes, I was the...  Like the photographer.  Yeah.  Boy, that felt good.  She did real well.  I was directing and she was actually doing it. 
[75:00]
 Yeah.  So now the picture's up for the listeners to decide if she's Playboy material.  Oh, and look, I can't even get any instant feedback.  So the service probably already crashed, but they're there.  They're there.  Hi, NW.  Hello.  Hi, what's up?  Yo, man, I just got to say two words.  Yeah.  Kara rocks.  Yeah.  Oh, you saw the pics.  Oh, man.  Isn't she hot?  Thank you.  One sultry picture you took of her, man.  The sultry.  Yes, the sultry shot.  That was my idea.  That killed me, man.  Isn't that good?  Oh, yeah.  She's got a great face and a great butt. 
[75:30]
 I like her.  All right, you guys rock on, man.  Hey, thanks.  All right, bye.  And Opie Joe in Jersey wrote saying, retard sexy has a definition.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  The audience is going through, waiting for the bunny to show her ears.  Ants shake a leg while I shook and they're up.  Hi, NW.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah, Tara.  That little minx is smoking.  Yeah, huh?  Oh, man.  You like that?  Do I take some more pics?  Wait, give her my number.  Was it worth the wait?  Oh, no doubt about that.  Yeah, you've got to love that.  Oh, man. 
[76:00]
 I'm going to go to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I'm going to the bathroom.  Yeah, you've got to love that.  Thank you.  See, on the Opie and Anthony show, we share with our audience.  Yeah, because I used to hate when I was growing up and I would listen to DJs have Naked Women  and stuff in the studio.  Yeah.  And you'd be like, man, they're not sharing with us.  You know, they describe it a little bit, but they just sit there and they lose it.  And then you don't really, you know, you put a picture in your head, but you always wonder. 
[76:30]
 Exactly.  So we have brought this technology to you guys.  Who needs that Vicky Secrets thing they're showing tonight?  Vicky Secrets?  Yeah, whatever.  Victoria Secrets.  We have our own little, yeah, who needs that?  Fashion show going on.  Hi, N.E.W.  Yeah, this is Jim from Long Island.  Yes, Jim?  Yes.  Nice to tell you.  Terror really is hot.  Yeah, see?  Yeah.  It's so dis- I have a picture.  I put a picture of my wallpaper on my computer.  Every time it's going to come on, she's going to be there.  Yeah. 
[77:00]
 Oh, man.  Hey, I'm one of your listeners from BAB.  Whatever happened, repo man and the convict.  Oh my God.  Espos, my buddy, he's doing fine.  Cool.  Espos works at the Burger King in Huntington.  Are you sure to get it back on the show?  Yeah, we definitely will.  Oh, that's right.  Opie's cute little show he had on BAB.  I got to go, man.  Right on.  Did you get any instant feedback in?  Because I can't get the instant feedback working.  I'm trying to get it working, but man, it's just jammed up.  Because we want to see what the listeners think of Tara. 
[77:30]
 You know what it is though?  I think a lot of the people that can get through to the website aren't wasting time on the instant  feedback.  Well, I understand that.  They're looking at the pictures of the lovely Tara.  Hi, N-E-W.  Hey guys, what's up?  I'm doing 100 miles an hour on the hutch right now trying to get home to see these damn pictures.  Well, be careful.  You don't want to cause any accidents.  But they're well worth it.  Yeah, you guys are the best.  Hey, thanks, man.  Take it easy.  Don't get a speeding ticket.  Don't worry about it.  All right.  All right, thanks guys.  All right. 
[78:00]
 Tara, you're a hit, man.  If we have all the cops listening right now, don't give anyone a speeding ticket because  they're just trying to get to their computers.  That's all they're trying to do.  And remember my face, no?  Yeah.  Very good.  Hi, N-E-W.  Anthony.  Yeah.  You're the man.  All right.  I finally got them up there.  And she is beautiful.  Isn't she?  She's extremely beautiful.  That's so great because a lot of times girls come into the station, a lot of DJs talk about  them and talk them up and somehow, some way you see them.  And what do they look like? 
[78:30]
 Oh, she's beautiful.  Well, sometimes they're slugs.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, sometimes they end up to be slugs.  Thank you.  But Tara, lovely.  All the luck.  Thank you very much.  All the luck.  All right, you guys are doing great.  All right, thanks, man.  See you around.  Take it easy.  All right, man.  See you.  Sharing with our faithful audience, Opie.  That's what it's all about.  Hi, N-E-W.  How you doing?  All right, what's up?  I just wanted to say Tara's looking hot.  Yeah, huh?  Yep.  Thank you.  And is this Opie and Anthony? 
[79:00]
 Yeah.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Say what?  That route with the total fag over there, it's how it started.  What a fag.  Yeah.  I said there was anything wrong with her.  No.  He's gay.  He's gay the day is long.  All right, man.  All right.  Thank you.  Hi, N-E-W.  Hello?  Yeah, what's up?  Opie and Anthony are there?  Yeah.  This is like making my day today.  This is great.  Thank you.  Unbelievable.  I needed to test a little bit.  I'm going to go to the bathroom.  I'm going to go to the bathroom. 
[79:30]
 I'm going to go to the bathroom.  I needed to test a long day at work.  See?  That's all we're trying to do.  Oh, not at all.  Let me tell you.  Perky out there.  Oh, thank you.  Very nice.  You like that part of the ride?  Excellent stuff here.  Keep it up.  Hey, thanks, man.  Take care.  All right.  Well, the reviews are coming in.  You're a hit.  Yeah, you're definitely a hit.  I'm kind of surprised.  I'm sure this is going to be ...  No, I'm reading the instant feedback and looking good.  Yeah.  I'm glad.  You know.  Man, is she hot.  I'd like her to do a velvet tongue or the I don't know how big it's going to get routine  out there. 
[80:00]
 Hey, here you go.  Now you're going to get that.  Does that disturb you at all?  Thinking that some of these guys, you never know what they're going to be doing in front  of their computer?  They're men.  It's okay.  I mean ...  You know, because if you stop them, then you know.  You could end up being some kind of a screen target.  You know what I mean?  Well, that's a good guy.  Guys tend to do that.  Sometimes guys tend to do that on these computers.  They're just being brutally honest.  That's all right.  Hey, it's all good, right?  Yeah, why not? 
[80:30]
 Where's the beaver shot?  Oh my God.  I'm just reading what's coming up here.  I'm sorry.  What the heck, man?  Where's the beaver shot?  It's just our listeners.  They're harmless.  Playboy, not Pentax.  All right.  Or maybe it's all shadowing.  Do you keep yourself well trimmed and well groomed?  Very, very well trimmed.  Very good.  O.B.  Hey, what's up?  A.L.?  Yeah.  Where's that guy on the Hatch?  Should I pull him over now or later?  100 miles an hour.  Hey, you leave him alone.  Leave him alone.  Hey, the guy's all over the road.  Go find a crackhead. 
[81:00]
 Listen, this is what I do for a living, all right?  I understand.  Well, you got to slow down.  Hey, listen, is she as hot as you say she is?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Definitely.  Without a doubt.  If you got a computer.  Does she play both, too?  Yeah.  I think so.  So tell her to go on with a hard tomorrow.  We're going to see how she does on the road.  Yeah.  I think so.  I think so.  I think so.  I think so.  I think so.  I think so.  I think so.  I think so.  I think so.  I think so.  Oh God.  He's talking guys. 
[81:30]
 Take care.  All right, man.  Oh yeah.  We leave it to the listeners.  Yes, we do.  We can't make those judgments, you know?  Well, the listeners love you.  We absolutely love you.  We can't even get more instant feedback.  I know.  Everything is jamming up.  Everything is jamming up.  You're a rousing success.  I think she deserves a big hand.  Thank you.  Wonderful.  I'm looking forward to seeing any kind of spread in one of the magazines.  I'll even autograph it for you and bring it in for you. 
[82:00]
 For you guys, anything.  All right, Tara.  So those pictures will be up for a while?  Oh yeah.  We could hang out some more, dude.  Oh really?  Why not?  Great, why not?  The Rock of New York, 1027WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony and Tara hanging in the studio.  on the WNEW website of the lovely Tara.  Finally able to get them online.  Yeah.  Yay!  And they're there.  Tara came in and she let us take pictures. 
[82:30]
 Some awesome shots.  Yeah.  And you get a bonus.  There's a bonus in those pictures for the faithful listeners.  There's a shot of Ben the Fag in the background of one of the pictures.  Which picture?  Well, it's one of, I believe it's the sultry shot.  And he's in the background and he says he's not gay.  Right.  He says he's completely straight.  Yeah.  And you look at him in that shot and he's completely disinterested.  Really?  He's not even looking.  He's just kind of, you know, looking away or something. 
[83:00]
 I don't know.  I don't know.  Now where is Ben?  Ben, come on down the hall and take your abuse.  Take your abuse like a fag.  Like a fag.  Hi, NW.  Hey, it's me.  All right.  You can go to those pictures in the tenor.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ, man.  What?  How many?  What?  What?  Yeah, that's exactly how we felt.  I'm taking them.  I'm going to have to work for words, man.  Speechless.  Thank you.  No, it's cool about it. 
[83:30]
 It's, um, she's natural.  Yeah.  Natural.  You know what I mean?  Definitely.  She's just got it going on and it's...  It's what most women look like, you know?  No, no.  Trust me.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Trust me.  It is not what most women look like.  It's what they should look like.  You going to put some more pictures up there?  Look at you.  Well, I'm just saying, it's like, you say what most women look like.  Well, it's what most women should look like.  Definitely.  You know, I mean, plastics are right, but it only goes so far.  Now, I'm talking about like the big fat pigs that are walking around, you know? 
[84:00]
 Yeah.  Because they turn around a lot of times and they go, this is natural and this is what  a woman's supposed to look like.  It's like, no, now you're taking it to an extreme.  Just a little too far.  Yeah, a little too far.  Hey, black girl.  What?  What do you think?  I haven't seen her yet.  She's right in front of you.  Oh, she's lovely.  You haven't seen her yet?  Oh, she's lovely.  She's lovely.  She's gorgeous.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Where's Ben?  Ben is, Ben left.  Ben left.  Ben left.  There's a hot girl in the studio. 
[84:30]
 Ben goes home.  Ben leaves.  There's that figure.  There's sales guys that are still hanging around.  They usually go home at 3.15 and they're still here.  Ben left and went home.  Oh, great.  All right, Earl, go over there.  Ann's got the pictures right up over.  Or do you, Ann, or no?  Oh, yeah, I'll pop them right up.  You can take a quick look.  We'll get the, we'll get the Earl, the official Earl opinion.  Look, very nice face shot there.  A nice sitting shot. 
[85:00]
 Your calling is to be a photographer.  Oh, maybe.  Look at that.  Here's the sultry shot.  Look at that.  And look at, look at Ben the fag.  Who I believe looking at this is looking at me taking the picture.  Geez, Ben.  Oh my God.  Then we have, look at that.  Yeah, that's.  Yeah.  Now we're getting down to the pant list.  Got the panties on and she's got the little like tank top thing, but it's got a little 
[85:30]
 spaghetti straps on it.  Yes.  And then she's pulling it off, exposing her belly and her panties, pink panties.  Yes, they are.  Yes.  Now she's pulling the top down a little bit, just exposing cleavage.  This is a recap.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And still, of course, with the hands off.  Well, this is for our blind listeners.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm doing that thing like those people were doing at the Super Bowl when they were singing  the national anthem and she was having a convulsion at the bottom of the screen for the deaf.  See, I'm doing this for the blind. 
[86:00]
 This is so the blind at home could spank it too.  This is like a braille smut.  All right.  Pulling it down.  Then we have the shirt completely off, but she's still holding it, you know, kind of  toying with you.  Getting ready to throw it.  I might put it back on.  I might not.  You don't know.  Then we go down to the bottom and of course she threw the shirt away.  There you go.  And yeah, you see a little anklet tattoo. 
[86:30]
 Just for you, Anthony.  Very nice.  So Earl, what do you think about that?  Don't say lovely.  Come up with something better than lovely.  I'm speechless.  I'm totally speechless.  Okay.  Very nice.  I got to say.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, how are you?  Hey, what's up?  Dude, what the hell has Ben the Fag thinking?  Is that his ankle?  Do you see in the picture he's looking at me taking the picture?  Oh man, I'm not a guy for internet porn, but damn, Tara. 
[87:00]
 Thank you.  Very nice.  I really appreciate it.  You guys do great work.  You've got to be set up for like all of eternity.  Oh man.  Look at this guy.  We just made his day.  Tell him you made my week.  I made my year.  All right, you want to go out sometime?  All right, man.  Bye.  Bye.  Don't let your mom catch you.  Yeah.  Really?  All right, listen.  Flavio, this guy's hysterical.  I had to rush through dinner to get back to my computer. 
[87:30]
 I told my wife I had to do some online banking.  Thanks for the pictures.  She's great.  Yeah, online banking.  He's going to be making a deposit.  Oh man.  All right, well, Tara, you were a huge success.  I haven't seen one bad instant feedback, to be totally honest with you.  You had to know it.  You know?  I don't know.  Other people see that.  The ones in the suits and the ties, it makes a decision.  I don't know.  But I think you guys are great, and I'm really glad you let me come on and do this. 
[88:00]
 No problem.  Anytime.  I'm going to leave you crying because I'm so happy.  Well, you're welcome back at any time.  Believe me.  You're welcome to call me.  I'll be happy to oblige.  Do you need a shoulder to cry on?  God, and you've got a sexy voice, too, by the way.  Thank you.  I do.  I do.  Radio voice?  Sure.  Really?  Sure.  I thought you had to sound like a man to be on the radio if you're a woman.  No.  I do.  Every time I hear a woman on the radio, it's what she's saying.  You want to know that the chicks that bend the bag, they sound like men. 
[88:30]
 You know, one other truth, every girl that sounds hot on the radio is a mess.  Yeah.  An absolute mess.  A mess.  That's usually the case.  So I've got like a package deal going on here, right?  There you go.  All right.  Yeah, definitely.  Thanks, guys.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, how are you doing?  All right, man.  I definitely give Tyra my vote.  Yeah.  Yeah, she definitely gets the vote.  As you guys are going through the recap, I'm sitting here going through the pictures.  I still have them on the browser.  You were playing along at home.  Oh, yes, I was. 
[89:00]
 Look at the fun.  Look at the fun you're having.  Yeah, it was great.  I was kind enough to sign off and just keep the pictures on my browser so that everybody  else can get a nice view.  Of course.  Save the page and sign off.  We've got to share the wealth.  Yeah.  What's your favorite picture?  Let's see.  The pose with her picking up her shirt, you know, ever so much.  Right.  To expose her panties is definitely a very sexy picture.  Yeah, okay.  Wait, wait. 
[89:30]
 Let me get to that one now.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, with the hair is kind of in front of one eye.  Yeah.  And she's looking down with that teasing look.  That seductive look.  Yes.  Oh.  Thank you.  Yeah.  You're a dirty girl.  Oh, dear.  Than the one next to it right before that.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Very nice.  She's pulling down the spaghetti straps.  Yeah.  But she definitely has a beautiful smile.  Of course. 
[90:00]
 Very nice face too on top of that.  Beautiful smile.  We were surprised when she came in.  Hey.  Well, we were.  Believe me, you should see sometimes what comes in here.  Yeah, when women call and say, hey, I want to like, you know, come up and do something  for you guys.  We're like, oh, great.  What does this mess look like?  Yeah.  And then we've got to make believe on the radio that she's hot.  It's just a whole mess.  Yeah, on page one, now go back to page one.  Okay, I'm on page one now.  Okay, now you see the first picture?  First picture with someone in the background.  That's Ben the fag. 
[90:30]
 That's Ben the fag.  Oh, that's me.  Oh, that's Rick.  Oh, that's Rick.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, he's not looking at her.  He's looking at you.  He's looking at me taking the picture.  Yes.  What a fag.  I'm glad you enjoy the pictures.  Yes.  I'm glad you enjoy the pictures.  Yes.  On my ride home, you were actually saying something about the full Monday, so I wonder  if there's going to be a part two.  Hmm. 
[91:00]
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  We're going to have to talk to her manager.  They want to call me back.  And you're missing one shot.  One shot.  We thought we had more coverage.  It's a very seductive look, but no, if you go back to what is it like, picture four on  the second page.  Wait, wait, wait.  Let me click up the second page.  Second page.  All right.  Now let me go to picture four.  Second page, first page.  She still has her clothes on.  Yeah.  Okay.  You need a picture like that with no clothes on.  There's no picture of her rear.  Well, yeah. 
[91:30]
 Oh, oh, yeah.  No, you know something?  I have one.  I just didn't post that yet.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he's keeping them for himself.  There he is.  Yes, sir.  Keeping that for my home collection.  Yeah.  No, I have a couple of other ones I guess I could post also.  I didn't put them all up yet.  Oh, okay.  Are you going to be posting them later at a later date?  This is like naked Hanukkah.  You have to wait a couple of days.  You get one present every day.  Of course.  All right, man.  Okay.  Take care.  Good talking to you. 
[92:00]
 All right.  Take it easy.  Bye-bye.  He's too good.  Hi, NW.  Hi.  Hi.  What's up?  You haven't been holding?  No, you're on the air live.  What's up?  What's up?  Oh, hey guys.  How are you doing?  Yeah, there's a delay.  Turn your A.  Okay.  With all due respect, she's a really cute girl.  Uh-oh.  No offense, but you're not Playboy material.  Why do you say that?  Give me a reason.  She's really cute.  Give me a reason.  You guys there? 
[92:30]
 Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  She's a really cute girl, but the thing is this.  I must be crazy or something.  I'm engaged.  I'm not a fag right now, but 36C, all right, I'd buy that, but they're not 21-year-old  breasts.  What are you talking about?  From the pictures I'm seeing, they're a little low.  She's going to be in Playboy.  She's going to be in Playboy.  She needs implants, the bottom line.  Oh my God.  I mean, no, I'm serious.  She's a cute girl, beautiful face, very nice, but I see Playboy no, swank, yes. 
[93:00]
 Well, wow.  Playboy no, swank, yes.  That was real necessary.  Thanks a lot.  I'm not being honest.  You know what?  There's a difference between being honest and being rude, and you could have just said  implants would have been better and not swank.  Don't you think?  Wow.  I'm just boxing them.  Come on.  It's the show.  It's the part of the show.  This guy's using our excuse.  You can't use our excuse, dude.  Come on.  That's all out.  Guys, you'd be very nice to an open.  I mean, I'm serious.  Very cute girl.  When I look at her in the street, absolutely.  But is she Playboy? 
[93:30]
 Come on.  You open a Playboy.  If you spend her, what, $3.50, $1.04, she's going to be a little disappointed.  Give me a break.  Why don't you give me a break?  I mean, I'm standing here and I don't have much makeup on.  It's not like the perfect lighting.  I'm sure if you know where to look at.  Tara, you don't have to defend yourself.  Listen, this is just a part of round two of that.  Goodbye.  Some guys are into that plastic look where it's just the big implants and the whole plastic  thing.  I don't know how his Beyoncé looks like.  Hi, NW.  Hello.  Yeah, what's up?  What's the website?  Jesus.  They're like an hour behind everybody.  I'm going to go to the website.

Because you guys are being really brutal to her, isn't it?  To who?  I don't think so.  No.  She deserves every bit of it.  Trust me.

And don't let that guy get you down.  There's hundreds upon hundreds of great emails from our listeners.  I told you there would be one. 
[99:00]
 Alright.  But there's always one or two.  Yeah, there's got to be.  And you should consider legitimate modeling too because you have beautiful face.  Oh, I definitely want to.  I told you I want to act.  You don't have to necessarily just do Playboy.  No, no.  It's just a fantasy.  You know what I mean?  Alright.
