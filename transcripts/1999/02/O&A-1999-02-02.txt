 The Rock of New York 1027 W.A.W. 2 for Tuesday, man.  Tadakash.  Whiskey in the Jar from Karajink and Nothing Else Matters from the Black CD.  Yeah!  I like to call it the Black CD.  Yeah.  I think my favorite album of the 90s.  Black.  Or one of them anyway.  When you look at this album, you ask yourself how much more black can this be?  And the answer is none.  None more black.  It's fine.  Now, speaking of black, we have Black Earl in the studio. 
[00:30]
 I gotta say your name slow because a lot of people think I'm saying Black Girl.  As in, yeah, girl.  Female.  But no, it's Black Earl, of course.  And besides being a friend of the Opie and Anthony show, Black Earl also works in the  marketing department here at A.W.A.  And we are cooking up something with Metallica.  Are we allowed to break this yet or no?  There's so many Metallica fans. 
[01:00]
 So close.  So close still?  We're still so close.  Can you give a hint?  People like hints.  Um, it'll be a unique concert.  So, alright, we're gonna give someone a chance to go see Metallica.  Yes, in concert.  Will it be in the New York area?  No.  Oh, wow.  So that's some good news right there.  Thank you.  Okay.  Metallica fans, stay tuned.  Stay tuned, yes.  Your official Metallica radio stages.  Well, we might be a few years away from that. 
[01:30]
 Yeah.  We're still getting out of the James Taylor mode.  Give us a little more time.  It's kind of hard to make that transition.  We did play Knock On Wood by Red Hot Chili Peppers today, though.  I mean, Knock Me Down.  What am I talking about?  Knock Me Down.  That's great.  Knock Me Down earlier from Mother's Milk.  Knock On Wood, yeah.  Who did Knock On Wood originally?  Eddie Floyd.  Thank you.  Okay.  Hey, here's...  Never mind.  It's too inside.  He'll know the answer to that music question I was asking you today.  Oh, yeah.  That's way too inside, though.  All right. 
[02:00]
 Anyway, where were we?  Oh, this is where we were.  Faxes, 212-957-WNEW.  Here's a fax coming in.  Hey, guys, please, please replay the Heston AIDS monkey bit from yesterday.  One of the funniest things you guys have done since coming to NW.  Wow.  Wow.  That came out of nowhere yesterday.  It really did.  Chuck Heston barged in.  He was all upset that they had found that AIDS probably started with chimpanzees sometime 
[02:30]
 about 100 years ago.  But didn't we know that already, that AIDS came from monkeys originally?  We didn't really have proof, Opi.  This was just some speculation.  So now they're saying that these chimpanzees got AIDS somehow 100 years ago and that it  was transferred to humans through the eating of monkey meat.  And for some reason, I can only guess because of Planet of the Apes, Heston just freaks  out whenever anything has to do with monkeys and chimps.  The Rock of New York, 1027-WNEW, 2 for Tuesday. 
[03:00]
 This note's for you live.  Come on, bring it home.  There you go.  And Southern Man, Neil Young, of course.  It's Opi and Anthony.  A little tidbit of information, I'll tell you.  Neil Young may be hooking up with Crosby, Stills and Nash.  Again?  For the first time since 1974.  Where are they going to play?  I don't know.  I just read it in the paper.  Old age home?  So they're still working on it. 
[03:30]
 That's interesting.  Yeah.  All right.  We've got the band back together.  Dude, we're getting the band back together.  Wow.  Anthony coming up with some music now.  How about that, huh?  Not bad.  Look at me.  A walking Rolling Stone magazine.  Is that where you got it from?  No.  It's in one of the papers.  Christine from Valley Stream writes,  Guys, I've been trying to get copies of the Stephen Lynch CD.  Are you sure his website is pushead at aol.com? 
[04:00]
 There is like 400 sites for Pushead.  You know, it's not a website.  It's his email address.  There's a huge difference there.  See people like popping up the browser on their friend's computer.  Okay, Pushead at a.  Oh, it says there's no such thing.  Come on.  No, if you want to get a hold of Stephen Lynch, our pal, our buddy, 
[04:30]
 it's pushead at aol.com.  That's his email.  You write a little email letter and say,  Hey, man, I want your CD or hey, man, you're cool or hey, man, I hate your guts.  I wish you would die.  Whatever you want to write the kid.  He'll answer you back and he'll answer you back.  Yes.  Pushead at aol.com.  But if I were him, I would get a webpage lickety split.  Yeah.  You know, people are looking for it.  That's where the future is going.  Yes.  Now, what do you got over there?  Well, I'll be I don't know. 
[05:00]
 It's something tragic.  I see on TV a trailer for a movie that's coming out with Juliet Lewis called The Other Sister.  Has anyone seen this yet?  I still haven't seen the trailer.  All right.  Rewind to the movie with Sean Cassidy and I think Linda Pearl and they're a couple of  retarded kids that want to get married.  And that's where the whole we're going to get married.  And of course, the parents are outraged because they're overprotective and don't think the 
[05:30]
 retired kids will be able to take care of each other.  But they get married and everything's fine.  Was this an after school movie?  I don't know.  It was one of those movies.  Or we could rewind to LA Law where the retarded guy that walked around there got a girlfriend  and everyone was concerned whether they could get along together and should they have sex  and what if they have kids?  Well, it's a serious issue facing retards.  Is it, Opie? 
[06:00]
 Is it?  Well, I'll tell you something.  What?  I saw this trailer.  What do you like to call these days?  Yeah.  What is the politically correct term?  You can't call them one thing or another because sometimes Down syndrome is different than  retard.  Or some other form of mental retardation.  Oh wait, Ralph Titor's got an answer.  I would think mentally disabled.  Mentally disabled?  No, that's what Anthony and I are. 
[06:30]
 We're mentally disabled.  I think it's mentally challenged.  Challenged now.  Yeah, because disabled would mean unable.  So that's an on-off switch.  So mentally challenged?  I got an observation.  What?  Here we go.  He's holding back, kids.  I don't think I should say it.  Well, it's your fault.  Oh, it's my fault.  I haven't even said anything.  He knows it's going to be offensive. 
[07:00]
 Well, you had to mention Down syndrome.  Yes.  Do you notice they all look alike?  They just have different wigs on.  Oh my God.  Bellboy, I need these bags taken out of here immediately.  What's bad about that?  Different wigs on?  Yeah.  Now that's horrible.  You ever go to Disney World or something and you see a whole...  They all have the same face.  It just looks like they have different wigs.  Why?  It's a genetic flaw, Opie. 
[07:30]
 Of course they all have the same features.  All right, but it's just an observation.  I don't mean anything by it.  Did I ever convey my story about Burger King?  Yes, you did.  I was the Down syndrome girl that works in the Burger King on New York Avenue in Huntington.  I walked in there.  Best service I ever got.  I swear to God.  I've been with these regular high school kids or whatever and junior high or whatever.  They're working in there.  They get the audits.  Screw it up every time.  This girl gets it right every time.  The change is right. 
[08:00]
 Nice service.  Anthony, back up your story.  What did you say before that, though?  When you told the story the first time on the air.  I was expecting a disaster.  Well, that just goes to show you I'm not open-minded.  I had my prejudice.  But then I realized she's very capable.  Yes.  I always go to her line when I go there.  Now let me just totally trash any image you might have of me now because let's go to this  movie trailer. 
[08:30]
 Oh yeah, we're back at the movie trailer.  Yeah.  It's Juliette Lewis.  Her movie is The Other Sister.  It is just, I mean, we get hell for doing like a corky Steinbrenner.  Ah, heaven and a con dog.  Heaven and a con dog.  And people call it going, you're horrible with that whole thing.  This is all they're doing when they're imitating and acting like they're a retarded little  couple.  Also, it's not real mentally disabled. 
[09:00]
 Unless Juliette Lewis is mentally challenged.  Okay.  You know?  I'm on the trailer for the new movie.  That makes you laugh, Anthony.  Is that true?  Oh, I'm on the floor every time this comes on.  It's corky.  Her boyfriend that shows up is corky.  And they're talking about sex and it's all...  Aren't they reading out of...  They're reading out of the Joy of Sex book.  What is retarded sex?  Well, that's what they're doing.  I don't want to retard sex.  It's gone too far. 
[09:30]
 Why?  It's a movie about mentally challenged sex.  What the hell is retarded sex, though?  I don't know.  I had some this morning.  He and Jen had some retarded sex, man.  We were drooling.  No, I'm just saying.  You know, I don't want to...  If someone has a definition for retarded sex, please fax it in a text.  Or send it on the Instant Feedback because I want to see what the listeners think retarded 
[10:00]
 Let's go through a little bit of this trailer and you'll see Juliette Lewis and her imitation.  Okay?  Okay.  Let's go.  Alright.  Winnie!  Your mother said another fifteen minutes.  Did you tell her that I don't like tennis still?  She said that all well-bred girls play tennis with chess or bridge.  Is it fifteen minutes yet?  See, she's getting whacked by tennis balls coming out of the machine. 
[10:30]
 It's hysterical.  I fall down, die laughing.  She's trying to hit him with the tennis racket.  I can't play tennis!  I mean, you don't think that's a scream?  You're going to hell, man.  Why?  I'm like, I'm roaring.  Alright, let's hear the rest of the trailer.  My parents, you get off my back.  But now at last, she's finally met someone who understands.  I want you to meet Daniel.  Don't worry, because I've been house-framed. 
[11:00]
 I'm telling you, that boy's a rich girl.  I don't think he's that kind of money.  I love Carla.  She's the only one that makes me feel like a person.  I mean, now come on.  That is definitely Corky's time, Brennan.  That's the same imitation I do as Corky.  I love her.  I'm a con dog.  We're in the paper game.  Right?  Am I right?  Yeah, okay. 
[11:30]
 Alright, let's listen a little more.  Seriously, how are you concerned?  Just the eye, unless the taste.  The parents are very concerned over this.  Page four is okay, but I don't want to do page one at fifty-five.  She's trying very hard.  See, I have a problem.  They're going through page one fifty-four again.  Like, they're going through the joy of sex, and they're going to have retarded sex.  I'm not going to the movies for retarded sex.  Think of a poor guy sitting there who hasn't gotten any in like a year. 
[12:00]
 And he goes to a movie and they're having retarded sex on their own on this one.  Well, look, it might be a touching story, okay?  It might be one of those movies we were talking about last week that the chick has to drag you to.  But you're going to go like, oh, cool, sexy, yeah.  You know, will you be sitting there going, like when you watch a regular movie 
[12:30]
 and you see a couple ready to go at it, like, oh, maybe it'll catch a peak.  Yeah, this is going to be good.  You want to see retarded sex?  Why are you hanging me out to dry here, Opie?  Say something, for God's sake.  It's too much fun to watch you scrim.  Let's continue.  All right.  To show that she's a responsible person.  This is a child's life and this is my child's life and I am going to protect her. 
[13:00]
 146. Looks pretty good.  Aren't you way?  I don't think that he can take care of you.  He can barely take care of himself.  Same story.  We can take care of each other.  An ordinary life is an extraordinary achievement.  You're just an agent and I'm talking to you children.  Say the parents.  It's a very important part of the job.  Very concerned. 
[13:30]
 I think there's one more line.  One more line.  Daniel's falling down.  Juliet Lewis, Diane Jesus, Tom Skerritt, and Giovanni Rubici.  I wonder who thought of touching his first face.  Who would have thought of it?  Amanda who thought of sex in the first place.  I think of Madonna.  I mean, well there it is.  That's the trailer for it. 
[14:00]
 So you're done with your observation.  I'm done.  Well the movie's been done a thousand times.  I think the mentally challenged community is going to be up in arms that real retarded people weren't used in this.  And it's been done a thousand times.  I don't want to go to the movies to see retarded love.  Retard sex.  Right.  So every time you see that trailer you're on the floor laughing, right?  God, I'm roaring.  I can't handle it because it's a bad imitation.  It's official.  You're more demanded than I am.  Come on. 
[14:30]
 They're sitting there like,  When is the time I'm going to get my bed?  They're doing it.  I think we should go to the phones next.  The Rock of New York 1027 WNEW.  We better get back to the music.  It's a little safer that way.  Anthony's on the loose today.  I'm separating myself from that one.  For a fresh second opinion and free videotape, call us at Staten Island University Hospital 1-800-285-4584. 
[15:00]
 1-800-285-4584.  I don't know about you, but I want to party with that guy.  Priceline.com, Anthony.  Ah, yes.  Great service.  Now we need a new angle to talk about Priceline.com.  They've been a sponsor on our show for over a month now.  Yes.  Got to freshen up the copy a little bit.  Okay.  So I'll give it a try here.  If you're thinking about having some retarded sex in the near future, and you need a hotel room, 
[15:30]
 I think you need to give Priceline.com a try.  Jack, is that a good angle?  I don't know.  Considering what we've been talking about today, I figured I'd try that angle.  I think maybe take two on this one.  Why?  There are people out there that are interested in retarded sex.  Well, I guess if there were...  You said you had retarded sex this morning.  I did. 
[16:00]
 Okay.  Me and Jen.  So I'm not saying anything bad by saying retarded sex, unless you were listening 15 minutes ago  and then you understand the connection.  Okay, then I guess you would want to save some money maybe.  Right.  If you're going to get a hotel room, and there's only one way to really save a lot of money.  Priceline.  Priceline.  Of course.  Yes.  Valentine's Day around the corner, you might want to do a little romantic getaway to have  that retarded sex.  Right.  And you don't want to pay top dollar.  No one wants to pay top dollar in this day and age. 
[16:30]
 You can name your own price for a hotel room.  And Priceline.com will match that price.  Right.  If you use their service, they're going to give you a free hotel night.  Free.  Free.  So you could have that retarded sex on a free night.  That's right.  Oh.  All right.  Only with Priceline's help.  Need a hotel?  Simple as this.  Give them a call and see what they can do for you.  If you don't like what they do for you, then you move on.  But I think you're going to be happy.  Oh, you'll be happy.  1027 WNAW, The Rock of New York, Tuesday, R.E.M. from Out of Time. 
[17:00]
 That's the radio song.  And what's the frequency?  Kenneth before that.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  All this visual bull, two for Tuesday.  Yeah, pretty nasty out there.  But we're having fun on the radio.  Of course we are.  Our lovely faithful listeners still haven't come up with a good definition for a retarded  sex.  So if you're looking to participate with the show today, you might want to send your definition  in.  You had to be listening about a half hour ago.  Yeah.  That's why you've got to listen a little longer to the show. 
[17:30]
 I guess.  And we also want to welcome all the brand new members of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  This is just taking off.  Hearing from a lot of people today, a lot of people getting inducted once again as they  listen to our show.  It's got a life of its own.  Soon we're going to have Hummerware.  We're going to come out with a little clothing that you can wear, proudly display that you  are truly a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Correct.  And I think we're going to have something to slap on your car. 
[18:00]
 Yeah.  Maybe some logos and stuff.  Maybe something like you put on the side of fighter planes when you shoot down somebody.  Maybe like a splooch thing.  And you can stick it on your door.  Like you're five of them and you're an ace.  You're an ace?  Yeah.  Like they used to put the jab zeros on the side of their planes.  Something like that.  And the Hummerware, this is kind of a cool thing.  We're going to give all the money to charity.  We're going to come up with some hats. 
[18:30]
 We are?  Oh, we are!  Yeah, it's called the Opium Anthony Charity.  We're going to have t-shirts and hats and other stuff.  Maybe some type of sticker you can put on your car and it will all go for a good cause,  believe it or not.  Believe it or not.  I know.  It's hard to believe.  But Jeffrey writing an email here.  He says, Opinac, I would just like to let you gentlemen know that I will become an official  member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club within the next hour.  What time did he write this?  3.45, 4.45?  I believe.  Oh, he's in. 
[19:00]
 Jeffrey is officially in.  I explained to my woman that Tuesday is a boring day and that I would like it spiced up a bit.  I told her about your club and she thought it was a great idea.  So thank you gentlemen for getting me what every man wants and craves.  Some casual oral.  Great show.  Please play the Special Olympics song for me later.  Cool.  There you go, Jeffrey.  A new member of the club.  Congratulations.  I redeemed myself last night in the eyes of my wife.  Well, you remember I was having a hard time with Half Life.  Yes. 
[19:30]
 My computer game.  Getting online.  Man, I blew it last week.  Real bad.  Real big.  Guys, let's get on a little something here.  If you come home and your wife has a great dinner cooked for you, a log in the fireplace,  candles lit all over the house, all over, and you walk in under no circumstances,  hang up your coat, sit in front of your computer and begin to play Half Life. 
[20:00]
 You did not do that.  Did you really?  I did.  This was last week.  So she methodically went around, blew the candles out, flipped the lights back on.  Then the next day, took off the teddy, all the candlesticks were gone from the house.  She went to the point now where she packed the candlesticks away.  Just put them away.  She was pissed. 
[20:30]
 You're a retard.  I know.  It tells you how incredibly stupid I am.  So last night I came in, candles all lit.  I didn't even give the computer a glance in the corner.  Honey, it looks great in here.  Believe me.  That's funny.  You had no clue?  No, I had a clue, but it's an addiction.  I couldn't stop. 
[21:00]
 You know how it is.  You think the crackhead that shoots his grandma in the head afterwards is going,  well, I'm glad I shot grandma.  No, it's more like, oh, damn, now I smoked the crack.  Grandma's dead.  You kind of feel bad afterwards.  Well, while we're on the subject of video games, I feel like we're going to be talking  about the game.  I finished India, finally.  You finished India?  It only took me two and a half weeks, but thank you.  Tomb Raider 3?  Tomb Raider 3.  I made it past India.  Very good. 
[21:30]
 Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Now how much further you got to go?  I'm a fifth of the way done with the game.  One fifth.  One fifth.  So by the time winter is over, I will complete Tomb Raider 3.  Now I can't imagine you haven't had any complications with you playing these games and in a relationship.  No, it's weird.  Sandy's like my co-pilot.  She came up with the final move in India.  I see.  The final move.  See, the final move, you've got to slide down this ramp.  Yeah.  And you pop out and it's like this pool with these platforms all around the room. 
[22:00]
 And in the middle is this guy they call the boss man.  And he throws fire.  And the first fire he throws makes the whole pool like a lava, boiling water pool.  Oh, no.  So you can't go in the pool.  Now you've got to run around the platforms surrounding this guy and shoot him before  he hits you with the fire.  Right.  And I have my pistols out, Anthony, and I'm going crazy over and over and over again.  I can't figure it out.  It keeps hitting me with the fire and I'm burning.  Damn.  What did you do?  Well, Sandy, I was kind of pissed that she figured it out. 
[22:30]
 She goes, no, man, what you've got to do is you've got to take your shotgun out and you've  got to jump immediately to the center square where the boss man is with the fire and just  unload the shotgun into him.  So I did that.  Bam, bam, bam.  Six shotgun.  He's out.  All right.  India done.  Thanks to Sandy.  See, I get in trouble.  Got to be careful, guys.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hello?  Yeah, what's up?  Who is this?  Aubrey and Anthony? 
[23:00]
 Yeah, what's up?  Hey, I was just listening to your bit on Juliette Lewis and stuff.  Yeah.  And I ran some groups for people with developmental disabilities, sexuality groups.  Yes.  And there's a lot of stuff going on.  You'd be surprised.  Like what?  Help us out here.  Share.  There's a large number of folks having sex on a regular basis.  Nothing unusual.  People with mentally challenged individuals having sex.  Yeah, people with developmental disabilities.  Got to be politically correct here. 
[23:30]
 Now, developmental disabilities?  Yeah.  It was so easy just to say retards.  I'm sorry if the term is offensive.  I mean, you've got to call them as you see them sometimes.  I call Anthony a guinea, so why can't I call a retard a retard?  Why?  Aubrey calls me a retard too.  That's right.  Not only that, but they're cool people.  I mean, I wouldn't...  Well, we know.  I completely understand that.  We know that.  But what's in a name?  Now, be honest.  Have you taken a peek at retard sex? 
[24:00]
 Be honest.  Have I taken a peek at it?  No.  Have you seen it?  No.  I've heard enough stories, though.  Well, give us one cute little story.  About people doing things in bathrooms and stuff like that.  Really?  Yeah.  But, shame on them.  See, I just can't imagine that somebody with some mental problems wouldn't just get complete  sensory overload.  Because I know I do.  You make these dopey faces and noises and you're riding around. 
[24:30]
 I just can't imagine somebody that can't really grasp normal relationships and stuff.  Yeah, but it's...  It's not totally freaking out.  It's human desire to stay safe.  You don't need to have a major brain...  You know?  It's just tougher to deal with because you can't process it all properly.  Sometimes it's just instinct more than anything else. 
[25:00]
 Do you even remember your first orgasm?  Oh, yes.  Do you?  Did it just freak you the hell out?  Absolutely.  It was like, hey, wait.  What the...  What?  This kind of...  Hey!  Hey!  This is pretty cool.  But you threw the GI Joe's.  Imagine how all of a sudden your toys get packed away.  And you can deal with it.  Imagine if you can't deal with it as well.  Oh, my goodness.  Well, once you're into it, you can't get away from it.  Well, I look at that Julia Lewis new movie there coming out and I just see them thumbing  through the pages of The Joy of Sex.  That was pretty bad.  Most people don't talk that way.  Yeah, I don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know. 
[25:30]
 I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know. 
[26:00]
 I just don't know.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  Come on.  Yeah, because I was like 14 or 15 and had no interest in just the opposite sex or just  sex in general.  They were starting to get scared and I remember they threw the book at me.  That's right.  Stop it.  I swear to you.  Wait, your parents gave you the joy of sex.  My memory is a little fuzzy but I think they left it in my room or something was going  on.  Yeah.  There must have been this big discussion between them beforehand. 
[26:30]
 Should we give them the book?  Well, because I was 15 and still into sports and everything, not showing any interest  in real life sex at all.  How embarrassing that is.  But I made up for lost time.  That's for sure.  But who were the guys?  Who you got?  Who?  Yes.  That is it.  You don't find that a little bizarre that your parents gave you a copy of the joy of  sex? 
[27:00]
 I got to get my mom on the phone or something.  She'll explain it I guess.  But no, my dad had a real tough time explaining the whole sex thing to me because I ran up  and I ran to the top of an apple tree and I refused to come down.  We told that story on the air.  Yeah, when he was going to have the talk with you.  Well, if you really want to get into it, it was the famous film at school.  Oh, the film.  That screwed everyone up.  All of a sudden you're going to school and you're assuming you're going to play another  game of kickball or play around with the big parachute in junior high. 
[27:30]
 Next thing you know you go to gym and they separate the boys and the girls.  Like, what the heck is this about?  They show you the movie.  All of a sudden, Johnny started growing hair in places he hadn't had hair before.  Hygiene is very important during this period in life.  You're like, hey, this isn't Hemo the Magnificent.  Wait a minute.  What movie is this?  So we're all looking at the screen just freaking the F out. 
[28:00]
 We're like, no.  And then the teacher comes on and says, if you have any further questions about anything  you just saw, your parents have been informed to discuss it with you.  So when I go ahead, go.  You may notice girls hips might be getting a bit wider.  They're growing breasts.  And your friends in the locker room have various sizes of genitalia.  If yours is small, don't worry. 
[28:30]
 You'll develop just like they did.  I'm trying to give you a little consolation.  So the story goes, I went home and they warned us that the parents were prepared.  And so my dad comes up to me and starts discussing and I ran right up to the top of a damn apple  tree and I said, I'm not coming down if you're going to continue talking about mom's boobs.  The Waltons running up an apple tree.  It's the truth.  Hi, N.A.W. 
[29:00]
 Yeah, hey.  First of all, you guys rule.  Hey, thanks.  Second thing is that Joy of Sex book.  I grew up, it's been on the shelf in my kitchen as a kid growing up since I was like four years  old.  Really?  I'm telling you, my friend used to come over and we'd come to the book and look at those  stupid illustrations.  Yeah, they were all those stupid pencil drawings.  They were like drawings.  Pencil drawings, yeah.  So, I mean, no one ever gave them to me, but I was just up there.  In the kitchen?  Yeah.  They kept it right in the kitchen?  Yeah, I was supposed to have it on the telephone next to the Bible and everything else, all 
[29:30]
 the other good reading.  See, there was probably a big discussion with your parents too, like, well, we should keep  this somewhere where they'll know where it is or if they need it.  So we won't have to talk about it.  Yeah, yeah, so we won't even have to talk about it.  I said, well, maybe the boys will find it on their own.  Right.  And the funny thing is, you know, I was about 14 or 15 and I swiped a box of Forex from  my dad.  Forex.  It hit him in the only place I thought my mother would have looked.  It was like I'm at Bar Mitzvah's, dude.  And he goes, just like, oh my God, I found these in his suit in his torridest closet. 
[30:00]
 My dad said, just put them back.  We've folded it years and years.  There you go.  All right.  Thank God.  That's my boy.  Thanks, man.  Yeah, the parents must just plan all that out.  We could put it here so that we won't have to talk about it.  Well, we are running really late, but we've hit a nerve.  1027 WNEW.  The Rock of New York, Jimi Hendrix, Red House and fire.  Before that, it's Opie and Anthony.  Someone like Edith Bunker orgasming to Hendrix's guitar.  That is a little out there. 
[30:30]
 A little surreal.  Yeah.  Well, we'd like to play all our Hummer clips on Tuesday.  Yes, we do.  We got the Donald Duck in.  We got the Hummer Queen song in.  Yes, those are Tuesday staples.  We haven't played the official song of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  That will happen in the 6 o'clock hour.  Of course, it's applied by Red Peters.  Red Peters, our pal.  I got this little ditty we can play really fast.  What do you got?  Considering Monica is on the front page of all the papers today. 
[31:00]
 Well, once again, we've got to hand it to the Post with their headline, Monica Zips  Her Lips.  Yeah, that's pretty cute, huh?  Anytime they could say lips in Monica or mouth, they will.  By the size of her, though, it doesn't look like she's been zipping any lips at all.  Bill's lawyer delivers apology.  That's sincere.  Jesus.  Oh, and I just turned the page.  Did everyone else see the cute little picture of the cause on page two of the Post? 
[31:30]
 Yeah, what's up with that?  Is he doing a stick?  Did we miss this last night when he was taping Letterman?  Did he come out like this with his little cute doggy slippers with the cigar out of  his mouth?  You see, I got my doggy slippers to make me feel good when I'm sick.  You see, I'm just like the retarded child on the David Letterman show. 
[32:00]
 Yeah, he's walking out with his bathrobe on.  He's got a cigar and all this, I guess, all his cold medicine or whatever.  Yeah, he's got the flu.  Maybe if you put down those big, stinking cigars, he wouldn't feel so bad.  Mm hmm.  Sucking on that big log.  Oh, jeez.  Well, I was going to play the Lewinsky song for Larry.  I am pulling every episode of The Little Rascals off the TV, because that's a racist show with 
[32:30]
 the bugweed and the stymie, you see.  Me and Camille are very offended by buckwheat, you see.  It doesn't portray a black child in a positive light, you see.  So he's the one we can blame for that?  Yes, the cause brought the rights to The Little Rascals there, you see. 
[33:00]
 But it's okay to put a black child cartoon character that talks like Wubba Bubba Cubba Bubba  on the Bill Cosby cartoon show, you see.  Because that's okay, you see.  Yeah.  I guess he found morals later on in his life.  I was offended, me and my wife Camille, by the buckwheat and the stymie.  But it's okay to have a big fat black guy go, hey, hey, hey, you see. 
[33:30]
 Well, that's awfully hypocritical of Mr. Cosby.  All right.  Hey, Cosby, are you a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club?  Yes, my wife Camille inducted me.  I just told her it was a Jell-O Puddin' Popper.  She went to town on that one, you see. 
[34:00]
 I am a member and a good stand of a Tuesday Night Hummer Club there, hey.  Now did you reciprocate?  Of course I reciprocated.  Of course I did.  What did you do?  Well, I got-get-get-get-get-get-get-get-get-get-get-get, you see.  Did you take the cigar out of your mouth for a few minutes?  Yes, I took the cigar out.  What do you think the cause is, an animal?  I went right down on that thing and I was like, I'm going to break his leg. 
[34:30]
 And she enjoyed that.  Like Jello Pudding.  The cause knows how to please the woman.  The cause can please the woman.  Get down, Camille.  Come here, Camille, lay down there.  Let me...  Hey, Camille.  Now I'm going to pull out my Jello Pudding pop, Camille. 
[35:00]
 Get down on it, Camille.  That's so good, Camille.  Now I'm a member of the Tuesday Hummer Club.  Well, congratulations, Mr. Cosby.  I hope you feel better with your flu.  Thank you very much.  Well, I wanted to play this ditty.  I don't know how we started talking about Cosby. 
[35:30]
 We were talking about Monica Lewinsky.  And where did Anthony go?  Ed?  You just missed the cause.  Oh, damn, I missed the cause was in here.  Where the hell were you?  I was talking with Perry White about a story.  Me and Jimmy Olsen.  Was Superman here?  You always miss the celebrities when they come in.  Oh, no.  All right, well, check out this ditty.  And we'll be back with...  You want to hear the who or collective soul?  Hmm, to go either way.  Yeah, you pick.  1027WNEW, The Rock of New York. 
[36:00]
 Tuesday, collective soul.  Off their new CD, Dosage, That's Run.  And if you like that song,  you want to check out the rest of the CD.  We're going to world premiere that for you.  Tomorrow night at 11 p.m. right here at NEW.  Soapy and Anthony.  Hello.  And now people are just freaking out  about the Tuesday Night Hammer Club.  Well, it's got a life of its own.  It's taking off.  It really is.  A lot of people getting involved, becoming members.  Of course, with the Laura Korn thing we had last week, 
[36:30]
 with that special technique,  it just revitalized people that were already members.  They wanted to become members with this new technique.  By the way, the new technique that Laura Korn...  Well, we gave out the secret.  Yes.  Because we sold her enough damn books.  Of course.  If you've had that done to you,  you are a platinum member of this...  Yes, platinum.  You're a platinum member of the Tuesday Night Hammer Club.  And you're entitled to platinum privileges.  That's right.  And we will give away the technique, you know,  one of these Tuesdays again. 
[37:00]
 Not today, though.  All right.  Instant feedback here.  I'm here with you guys.  My guy David is fighting the traffic on Route 80 right now  after having a real S day at work.  Could you help me put a smile on his face  and tell him that he'll be initiated  into the Tuesday Night Hammer Club tonight?  And then she writes, hee hee hee hee hee.  You can also tell him I love him.  Just don't say my name because my daughter may be listening.  Oh, that rocks.  See, this is what it's all about.  Just making people happy, you know? 
[37:30]
 That's it.  Just have a lousy day, lousy commute home.  It's Tuesday.  It's kind of boring.  And then you have that to look forward to.  Denise says she wants to become a member  of the Tuesday Night Hammer Club.  All right, Denise.  Well, find a guy and go to town.  My wife says that at the moment...  Oh, we were talking about retarded sex earlier?  Oppenac.  My wife says at the moment when I reach total happiness,  I do this retarded act.  Curled arms, stupid face, shaking uncontrolled,  but boy, does it feel good. 
[38:00]
 That's the definition of retarded sex.  Everybody does that stupid face.  Oh, my God, I can't read that one.  I mean, I could, but then we'd be kicked off the radio.  Pete thinks I'm gay.  No, Pete, I'm not.  Pete thinks you're gay.  All right.  Rick is telling us that we have a couple in the car.  Okay.  They want to talk to us.  N.E.W., what's up?  Hey, I wanted to know if I could get on the air  because if I did, I'd give my husband my hammer  Tuesday.  We're driving home from work. 
[38:30]
 You're on the air.  I'm on the air?  Yes.  Well, then I guess I got to go to work.  Now, what road are you guys on?  Route 78.  No kidding.  Now, who's driving?  He is.  Uh-oh.  That's dangerous.  Oh, no.  If you're on Route 78, watch out, guys.  Yes, sir.  Thanks, guys.  We'll do it.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Give him the phone.  Hold on.  We'll see how far we can go with this.  Which one of the Wacos do I have?  Both of us.  I love you guys.  Thanks.  I'm a big fan of you guys.  Are you officially a member of the club or are you going to become a member? 
[39:00]
 I'm going to be real soon.  Yeah?  She's going to do it on the road?  She swears.  I said, every Tuesday I come home.  I'm like, it's Hummer Tuesday, Hummer Tuesday.  And I've been beating on her, so we're commuting home tonight.  I'm like, you owe me one.  It's Hummer Tuesday.  Well, what do you say?  You at least get things started right now.  That works for me.  All right.  Let her rip.  Got to get started, honey.  All right.  Just describe what she's doing carefully.  Right now I'm zipping my drawers.  All right.  And how fast are you going? 
[39:30]
 Right now I'm all over the road.  How fast am I going?  Are you kidding me?  All right.  I've got a couple of cars in front of me.  I'm going to probably start smashing into them.  Well, be careful.  Be careful.  I don't know how to win it.  It's worth it.  All right.  Now what's going on now?  Well, we're starting.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to be a little nervous.  I'm going to be a little nervous.  I'm going to be a little nervous.  I'm going to be a little nervous.  I'm going to be a little nervous.  All right.  Now what's going on now?  Well, we're starting.  Oh, my God.  I wish you guys were here.  No.  Actually, I wish.  What's that doctor's name?  Dr. Korn?  Yeah. 
[40:00]
 She's a pisser.  Yeah.  She really is.  We're going to have her back on the shelf.  What you've got to do is see if I can get a chapter in her book.  So what do you think of the impeachment hearings?  Actually, I'm chatting sheep right now.  I want to make sure I last a little longer.  I want to make sure I last a little longer.  I want to make sure I last a little longer.  I want to make sure I last a little longer.  I want to make sure I last a little longer.  I want to make sure I last a little longer.  Actually, I'm chatting sheep right now.  I want to make sure I last a little longer.  You know?  Oh, my God.  All right.  Put the phone down there.  I've got to talk to her real fast.  Okay.  Hold on one sec.  I'm a little busy.  I'm just starting.  All right. 
[40:30]
 We'll let you love first call, man.  Thanks.  All right.  See you.  See you.  See you.  See you.  See you.  See you.  See you.  See you.  See you.  All right.  See you.  All right.  Wow.  If anyone else is on Route 78, look out.  There's a car that's swerving all over the damn road.  It's like, a little busy.  All right.  There you go.  I thought he put Corky on the phone for a minute. 
[41:00]
 Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, two for Tuesday.  With Rush, Roll the Bones.  You think Rush is sitting there now, now that that song's eight years old going, you know,  I wish we didn't put that part, that rapping part in that song.  Yeah, maybe rapping wasn't a good idea for that song.  Yeah, there was a time where just like every artist that put out a song had to have the  rap section in it. 
[41:30]
 Just a little bit.  Pretty ridiculous.  Well, you remember in the early 90s, even McDonald's was rapping on their TV commercials.  It was just the thing to do.  Yeah.  Mayor McChese laying down a rap.  Yeah.  But Roll the Bones, I liked the song a lot.  And then all of a sudden I said, oh, that's right.  This is the rapping Rush song.  Rapping Rush.  All right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  And this Hummer Club thing, I think, no pun intended, but the club has exploded this week.  It really has.  No pun intended.  Great. 
[42:00]
 I mean, we can't talk about anything else today because that's all everyone wants to talk about  is becoming members of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  People are bragging all over the place.  And this guy didn't sign his name, but he's from Jersey.  He writes on the incident feedback.  You guys rock.  I just got home from work and found a note on the counter.  Hi, honey.  Be home at 715.  Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  I owe you guys.  Keep it going strong, man.  How about that?  That's huge.  She left a note on the counter.  That's pretty hot. 
[42:30]
 I got one from Pete, Franklin Square.  Oppenac, please help me out here.  My wife, Denise, is in the kitchen cooking.  We always listen during dinner.  Please explain to her I need the Hummer Club.  Tell her it's for medical reasons, whatever it takes.  Thanks in advance.  I'll forever owe you guys if it works.  Okay, Denise, you're in the kitchen right now.  Your man needs the Hummer.  Put down the butts and pants.  Was that the second one? 
[43:00]
 It was, right?  I hope so.  I hope so, too.  Stone Temple Pilots and the Hummer Club.  Stone Temple Pilots on the Rock of New York.  1027 WNEW.  We lose track of time when we do this radio show.  It's two for two.  Big Empty and Creep from Core.  Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, man.  And OJ back in the paper.  OJ, yeah, they're auctioning off some of his goods.  And look at the post.  They've got to put the goods all there with the price tag.  In the middle it says, to die for.  It's tacky over there, man. 
[43:30]
 The post, they must just smoke a lot of pot when they put the paper together every day.  Because the front page of the post today says, Monica zips her lips.  Yeah.  And then, yeah, like you said, the OJ, to die for all the items that are up for bid.  Yeah, they're sitting there making the headlines like,  So, what do you think, dude, we'll put to die for?  That'll be hysterical, man.  Now, when the OJ thing hit, killing his ex-wife and all that, 
[44:00]
 did you ever think in your wildest imagination that there'd be a story  huger than that that would come out?  No.  I remember just going, wow, it'll never get better than this.  But the president getting the Hummer in the Oval Office.  Definitely tops it.  It's not as fun.  It's a bigger story.  But it's not as compelling as the OJ thing was.  Yeah, because you had all the characters.  You had Kato and Judgito and Cochran.  Yeah, and the whole thing with the president, like the lawyers talk and 
[44:30]
 everyone's denying everything.  But the OJ with the Bronco thing, and that was just great.  Yeah, it really was.  It was great TV.  It was so tragic and ridiculous at the same time.  And now they're auctioning off some of his goods, Opie.  Well, the Heisman Trophy's going for over $100,000.  I guess that's the starting bid on that.  The prize item right there.  A three-quarter life-size sculpture of Simpson going for $2,000 to $3,000.  Doesn't even look like him, though.  Looks more like Black Earl than OJ. 
[45:00]
 The Football Hall of Fame Proclamation, doesn't it?  That looks like Black Earl.  Yeah, the black crypt keeper.  And then you could get a professional football hall of fame commemorative football.  I want the knife.  Yeah, where's the OJ knife?  OJ is in such trouble financially.  He should just, at this point, go, OK, here's the knife.  He can clear his debts.  Clear my debts as I look for the real killer. 
[45:30]
 Yeah, right.  Whatever happened with that, OJ, years later, years and years later,  we are still looking for the real killer, I swear.  What a sack.  Anyway, I have to thank OJ Simpson.  Yes.  Tell you the truth.  Yes.  And why?  Well, if it were not for OJ Simpson, I would not have this wonderful radio show.  I would not have this wonderful radio career.  Well, I think you would have had it.  No, I don't think so.  I think it was just a chain of events that happened that if any one link was taken out, 
[46:00]
 it just wouldn't have happened.  Yeah.  OJ, it's not that easy to get into radio.  Well, you did a few voices for Howard before I met you.  But that was just like voices.  I wasn't like on the payroll.  You know what I mean?  Well, the deal is, it is OJ that brought Anthony and I together.  Yeah, like I...  It figures, right?  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal. 
[46:30]
 It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal. 
[47:00]
 It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  It was a great deal.  You would get maybe like a five minute tape of The Greased Man a couple bits on.  You're like, wow, this is really cool.  This is funny.  This is great stuff.  Then when he came to New York and he started doing it night after night and it was just  five hours of that over and over and you got a lot of stuff.  It's like, oh my God, this sucks. 
[47:30]
 It's horrible.  I was a singer with the village people there.  He had a lot of it.  He'd make up these stories and it didn't make much sense.  The stories would go on for 20 minutes just to tell a punch line.  I was on the police force and I was patrolling up in Harlem.  This gang started shooting and I slinging lead there.  And you're like, yeah, what?  And then I just go into a song or something. 
[48:00]
 I didn't finish or anything.  So anyway, the OJ Simpson thing hit and I was doing my radio show.  And I'm even attempted to do that in knowing you.  We cut that crap right off at the mud when I came aboard.  Anyway, I asked all the local bands to send in like songs about the OJ trial because it  was huge.  Yeah, absolutely huge.  And I got honestly about 20 or 30 songs from bands. 
[48:30]
 That's why we're encouraging you guys to write a song about the Tuesday Night Hammer Club.  We'll play them on the air.  Sure.  I don't know if you can join our radio show.  It's great exposure for your band or it's a great way to get into radio.  So Anthony's band at the time, Rod Cut, came up with this song about the OJ trial and I  played it.  And then just like our Stephen Lynch songs, people just started calling like crazy, requesting  the OJ song over and over again.  And then Anthony and the band came in, played it live, jabbered John off the air and figured 
[49:00]
 we had some kind of rapport that might work on the air.  Yeah.  Oh, what?  That's not how it went?  No, that's how it went.  What?  You're going to bash me now?  No, I'm not going to bash you.  What?  That I came in like tanked, drunk or something?  There were those days, but that's in your past.  I was in construction.  I had to drink.  It's the law.  But anyway, yeah, then we started doing radio together in the rest of the country.  But we figured we'd take a stroll down memory lane today because OJ is in the paper. 
[49:30]
 This was the tune.  And this was the song.  We'll see how funny it really was, I guess.  Four years later.  Got me interrated.  Yeah, it could be a little dated, but here's...  Of course it's dated.  It's just this is a little reminder of how we hooked up.  I just figure if you're faithful to the show, this will be a ventricle.  Oh, look at that.  It brought a tear to my eye.  A little flash from the past.  Look how wrong you are, though.  What?  Being politically incorrect?  No, I mean, did anyone think he would have got out of that one at the time? 
[50:00]
 I know.  He was supposed to get the electric chair.  Absolutely amazing.  Who knew?  All right.  There you go.  A little trip down the...  A little bit of trivia we might ask you in the future for a prize.  Old memory highway.  Yeah.  You never know.  We're going to start doing that.  Yeah.  Hope you and Anthony trivia so we know we give our prizes to the faithful.  Make sure you listen and damn it.  That's right.  All right.  I don't know.  Are we going to be back?  I don't know.  What time is it? 
[50:30]
 Wow.  I know.  Wow.
