 Hey!  Good afternoon everybody!  Like in a mad dog show here on the fan,  of course everybody equally amazing the beginning of the NBA season tonight.  The next in action is another thing like that.  Isn't that right, Maggie?  That's right, dog.  Everybody wondering if Patrick Ewing is going to lay back a little bit 
[00:30]
 and try to take all the shots at it today.  Unbelievable. God, I love listening to that guy.  Boy, I wonder what they're talking about on the fan this afternoon.  Well, I got an interview with Tom Siva.  We were listening to the fan on the way in.  Yes, we were.  My God, Tom Siva was on?  Is this guy a little full of himself?  Just a little bit.  Well, Tom, I must say you love match baseball.  Well, that's right, I am.  I'm great. I'm the greatest thing ever to come out of the match. 
[01:00]
 Geez, this guy just seems pompous.  He sure does.  Yeah, that was fun.  It's going to be tough to fill on McCarver's shoes over there.  Well, of course it is. You've got to give McCarver a lot of credit.  You know, he wasn't terrible.  He was a very good commentator.  But Tom Siva also bringing something else to the Mets team,  a little pitch-kicking coaching.  That's right.  He's going to be talking with the pitchers and the hitters  on what to look for in pitches. 
[01:30]
 Oh, brother. What a mess.  What a blast. Love it.  All right, Sophie, it's Anthony, and yes, it is FU Friday,  and we are ready to rock and roll once again for you guys today.  Once again, we turn the show over to the people to voice their gripes  and bitches that they've had over the week.  Anthony, can I throw out the first FU?  Ho-ho.  Actually, I'll let Morgan from Astoria throw it out.  I would like to send a big FU to the NBA  for trying to palm off this sham season on us.  I hope they all develop career-ending knee problems in the first week. 
[02:00]
 Well, a lot of injuries in the NBA, obviously,  taking its toll on the players who love and practice a lot  throughout the time of the lockout.  Lock, lock, lock.  That they couldn't play.  No, the lockout.  That's what I said, lockout, lockout.  Could you say Friday?  Friday.  Don't make fun of my speech impediment.  What are you talking about? I just wanted to hear Friday. 
[02:30]
 Could you say Saturday tomorrow?  Heavens to Murgatroyd.  Suffer and suck a hat.  All right, and let's throw an FU out here from Jerry from Peekskill.  Opie and Anthony, this is good.  This is something I've been really bothered by.  I would like a big FU to all of the scientists who give an ass  if Pluto should be called a planet or not.  Yeah, is this hysterical?  All these geeky scientists are arguing over whether Pluto is big enough  to be considered a planet.  Yes, and Jerry writes that we have an ozone problem, world hunger, 
[03:00]
 homeless people, etc., and these douchebags are sitting around  with poles up their asses discussing what it should be called.  Who gives an effing rat's ass?  Thanks for your time, you guys.  Effing rule, Jerry.  You know what's funny?  Do we even know there is a Pluto?  I mean, come on.  Who cares?  The thing is billions of miles away, like Ope says.  I think there's more things to worry about here.  There you go.  All right, we're just getting started here today.  Yeah.  Send your FUs in through the fax machine is the best way today. 
[03:30]
 212-957-W-I-D-W, or you can use the instant feedback.  Everyone's still commenting about Tara.  My Lord, you guys.  How many emails did we read before we went on the air today?  Five.  Well, 300 came in the time I was sitting in the office alone.  And then tack that onto the 200 that were waiting when we got here.  Yeah, we've got over 500.  At least.  So what I must say at this point in time, don't be mad if we don't 
[04:00]
 write you back because at this point it's impossible.  If you could take one more, Freak says she's cute but not model material.  More nude biker bar type material.  Well, should we put this one to rest, you think?  Definitely.  We have read all the feedback on Tara and most people admit that she is a lovely lady.  She's beautiful, has an unbelievable face, probably could be a model,  but she is not Playboy material. 
[04:30]
 Right, that's what everyone's saying.  That is the majority of what has been said the last three days.  And that's fine and now we lay it to rest.  Well, now what I'm thinking, because we're also getting a lot of email from ladies who think they have a better body than Tara.  Okay.  I see smoke coming out of OPZ.  So if you've seen Tara's picture on the NAW website by now and you think you have a better body,  a body that is good enough for Playboy, I think you need to get a hold of us. 
[05:00]
 Oh, people come, girls come down here.  Well, Tara's pictures will stay up there until someone beats her.  Oh, I like this.  You know what I mean?  So now we get another girl down here.  Yes.  Who thinks she's better than Tara.  Yes.  We take her picture.  Yes.  Put it on the web.  With Tara and then have everyone vote if Tara's been dethroned.  Ah.  As the hottest natural babe to be in the OP Anthony studio.  Yeah, only natural girls.  We're going natural.  We're not looking at implants or anything like that.  No implants for the boys. 
[05:30]
 That's an unfair advantage.  That's right.  Oh, I like that.  So if you're a girl, you're lovely, you've got a real nice natural look and you've maybe  had some fantasies about posing topless and want guys to look at your topless pictures.  Correct.  We'll pop you on the website.  That's right.  We'll do a little photo shoot and then the guys can judge on who's better.  And then you'll be the king of the page.  There you go.  Queen of the page.  Queen of the page until someone beats you. 
[06:00]
 So until then, Tara's pictures will remain up.  OK.  Could be weeks before she's dethroned.  You never know.  Guys, comb the area and find a girl you think is worthy.  It's OP Anthony on FU Friday and Mike from Old Bridge, New Jersey writes a big FU to  the ticket scalpers at tonight's Savage show.  $115 and up.  Wow.  That's the best.  The Rock of New York, one of the seven W.N.E.W. Metallica turned the page. 
[06:30]
 We're putting something together that is very cool that involves Metallica and you guys,  the faithful listeners of N.E.W.  We don't have all the details yet, but black girl is pumping his fist in the air.  He's excited.  Are we getting close to being able to pop this on the air?  Come on.  Got to be soon.  We're going to fly you somewhere to see Metallica.  We can tell them that much, right, Earl?  We just did.  OK.  It's OP Anthony.  It is FU Friday.  I think our favorite day of the week. 
[07:00]
 Yeah.  We get to a vent.  Exactly.  More so than usual.  Dear OP Anthony, a giant sized FU to the jappy girl who bumped into me this morning at Starbucks.  She dumps her coffee all over my black cashmere coat and then demands that I buy her a new  coffee because I violated her space.  Violated her space?  Get a life.  FU to her.  Good show, Shelby.  We've got to get this one out of the way.  Gary from the city.  What's that?  ONA, I would like to send a big FU to the cops who put 41 rounds of bullets into an 
[07:30]
 underarm man outside his apartment.  Ouch.  You know, I hate those peddlers as much as the next guy, but 41 shots.  I think that's a little harsh, huh?  Yeah.  Well, I guess they were investigating that rapist and oops, wrong guy.  I think the cops freaked out because they went into his apartment.  They saw all those pictures of Leonardo DiCaprio hung up in that apartment of his.  Yeah, what's that?  What's the story of that?  I don't know. 
[08:00]
 Pictures of Leo in his house?  I can't think of many guys that hang pictures of Leonardo DiCaprio all over their room.  Well, it doesn't merit 41 bullets being shot at you.  Maybe they freaked out a little bit.  22 times they said he was hit, something like that, right?  That's appalling.  That's horrible.  I'm, you know, get back to the range.  41 shots and you only hit 22.  Oh, this is harsh.  It's an outrage. 
[08:30]
 All right, let me move on here.  To Afanak on FU Friday, I'd like a big FU to be sent out to my wife who won't let me  join the Hummer Club.  I've been begging for two weeks now.  Her name is Missy.  We are listening to you right now.  Missy, come on.  Missy, someone named like Missy you don't expect to join the Hummer Club.  This one is a fave of Anthony.  FU to all you big fat white trash pigs that insist on wearing skin tight stretch pants 
[09:00]
 to show off your big fat asses.  Do you really look in the mirror and think to yourself you look good?  Are you F'ing blind you a-holes?  That's Jim from Douglas 6.  What is going on?  These women with the big fat butts and the big beefy thighs wearing those stretch pants,  those tight stretch pants and then they usually wear the heavy sweater that comes down over  their ass as the full get up.  That's like their get up every day. 
[09:30]
 But you see like the surface of the moon on the back of their thighs.  You can see it right through that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like big fuck and I can't lie.  They got the stretch pants and the cellulite working and then the big sweater covering  it.  Thank God for the big sweater because if not you see the, I have to say it again, the 
[10:00]
 bunt.  It's all I'll say.  I think everyone knows what it is.  All right.  Well look at this.  I've got to move on again here.  What?  We're just talking about things.  I guess for this break I'm good cop and Anthony's bad cop.  Watch how the roles change many times during the show.  Don't let them onto that little secret.  That little rouge.  That ploy.  That old gag.  All right.  We got a four pack of tickets to Lowes Theater. 
[10:30]
 Movie tickets.  Oh cool.  And I thought that we could have some fun giving these away.  We want to give our prizes to our faithful listeners, the people that have been with  us for quite a while.  Yes listening.  Because we know there are a bunch of concert pigs that all they do is listen to radio stations  24 hours a day to try to win stuff.  Hit redial and three phones work.  And they don't even really care about the radio station.  They just listen because they know they're giving stuff away.  Right.  So we're going to try to make sure it goes to someone that definitely listens to our 
[11:00]
 show.  Yeah.  So we're going to start something new on the show today.  And we're going to do this for now on.  Opie and Anthony trivia.  Yeah.  See if you guys are paying attention to the radio show.  We usually convey maybe some something of our past.  Maybe something in a bit that you might remember.  And you'll be quizzed.  Yes.  And rewarded.  Well it's going to be easy.  Two one two seven five seven one oh two seven.  The first person that could tell me we'll start easy right.  OK.  What Popeye calls olive oil's private part. 
[11:30]
 I got that.  That's an easy one.  All right.  Let's go to the phone.  Hi.  Any W.  Hi.  Who's this.  This is Jeff Gershwin.  We come from and I'm calling from Manhattan.  All right.  You got an answer to our question.  Yeah.  There you go.  Of course.  It's the whiskey.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Do you turn on your radio radio.  I hate listening to myself in the way. 
[12:00]
 All right.  It's all right.  All right.  Man.  Yes.  You know how easy that is.  Yeah.  And now you've got a four pack of tickets to Lowe's Theatre.  All right.  Great.  How long have you been listening in.  I've been listening since you guys started.  It was a little rough in the beginning.  I'm glad you stuck with us.  Yeah.  You guys are great.  Don't worry about it.  Stuck through the tough times.  Oh.  Glad you knew it's the whiskey.  All right.  Man.  Congrats Galashkin.  Yeah.  Hold on the line.  You guys are great.  Thank you.  There you go.  We'll have another chance next hour.  It's that easy. 
[12:30]
 Yeah.  All right.  And more stupidity on the way.  Getting a bunch of requests for another Stephen Lynch song.  We try to play one a day.  We could play nine a day.  I would love to but we don't want to burn them out too much.  So before four o'clock I think we'll do If I Was Gay.  The Rock of New York 1027WNEW Collective Soul from Dosage.  That's heavy.  We're going to leave you and Anthony hanging with you on this FU Friday.  Sun is out and we are rocking and rolling.  Yeah.  Feeling good.  Feeling very good.  We've had a great week of radio.  I had a lot of fun and we're going to continue moving forward here man. 
[13:00]
 Forging ahead as they say Opie.  Forging ahead.  And we're paying attention to all the email you guys have sent us lately.  Yes.  The one interesting thing for seeing is a lot of people that really, really did not  like us at all when we first started but said that they gave us a chance and now we have  finally grown on them.  Yeah.  And I want to acknowledge you guys for giving us a chance because there was a lot of people  at first they they hated us and and that was after the first break we did and they left  the station and never came back. 
[13:30]
 These were what we call the dark days.  We're working on our own behind the music special here at W.  When they first got there they wanted to kill themselves.  Right.  Yeah.  But thanks for giving us a chance and then we want to acknowledge that because we're  seeing that in the email a lot lately.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you.  A bunch of people calling up they want to hear Stephen Lynch.  Yeah.  We're working on a live broadcast that most likely will happen a week from today.  We're going to take a few Friday on the road again. 
[14:00]
 We like doing this.  The last time we did it was the Bronco bashing.  We had a great time.  We like getting out there and meeting you crazy bastards.  Yes.  And we have fun when we go out.  We party.  We have a lot of fun.  We're not.  You know it's funny too when we go out a lot of people come up and go oh you're not what  we expected.  The radio industry has totally ruined it for a couple of the good people that are out there.  You know.  Like we like to go out and party and have fun and meet the people. 
[14:30]
 And a lot of people that go to radio appearances what happens?  There's this big fat jerk off in a booth somewhere.  Right.  In a VIP lounge.  In a VIP lounge.  Or maybe they trailer this big like boom box looking thing to a location open and he sits  in there and spins the records.  Hey let me take your request.  Fantabulastic.  Yeah we changed the whole live appearance thing big time.  When Anthony and I first started working together we went to a bunch of live appearances and 
[15:00]
 they had this huge VIP area set up with bouncers and bodyguards and it was up on a balcony  so you know you guys would be well protected over there.  We're like screw that we're going to party with our listeners.  What the?  Wait a Vita?  Yeah.  It's supposed to come out on the balcony?  You know so you will not see a VIP lounge all rowed.  You know big fat bruiser guys being paid in the asses.  We hang we party that's what it's about. 
[15:30]
 Big fat old jocks that sit on their ass all day sit on their roids all day spinning records  they go out and meet their public.  Well they don't really meet them.  No.  They don't want to meet you guys.  They're in the VIP section.  No we're going out and we're getting it together for Friday.  We're going to have Stephen Lynch with us man.  Hopefully.  We're just waiting for his manager to call back to tell us that Stephen Lynch.  Screw his manager.  He better show up.  Well this is the only problem.  If he's in town he's going to be there but Stephen Lynch because of our show he's starting 
[16:00]
 to get a little famous and now he's you know traveling around a little bit.  Oh sorry what?  Has he got Leno book?  Is that it?  He's out on the left coast?  He better get his ass to where we're going to be.  Stephen listens to us every day so Stephen why don't you give us a call and tell us personally  that you will be at our live broadcast next Friday to do a set for our lovely listeners.  Right.  Alright.  Touch, Feel, and Stand.  Days of New on 1027 WNEW the Rock of New York. 
[16:30]
 Hope you know Anthony for your FU Friday.  And they are coming in like crazy once again today Anthony.  Yeah.  People are getting into the groove of FU Friday.  Greg from Staten Island writes, guys please send an FU to my ex-girlfriend for breaking  up with me nine months ago and not giving a crap about it until she saw me with my hot  new girl last week.  Now I get all the I made a mistake crying phone calls so FU to her turn off the freaking  waterworks and stop calling me.  You guys are great.  Keep it up.  Yeah I've always been one for the clean break man. 
[17:00]
 Whatever you break up just that's it.  Never again contact.  No phone calls.  No nothing.  You're lucky.  It's just it's the worst.  That's not the norm.  You gotta do that.  Most times you gotta break up slowly.  Then eventually you gotta find like a neutral area to exchange your stuff. 
[17:30]
 The neutral zone.  The neutral zone like exchange of the prisoner exchange.  Like hey man I want all my black crows CDs back.  I want my Pearl Jam concert shirt back.  You know and she wants this back.  Find a neutral area and you exchange the stuff like a prison exchange.  Yeah a prisoner exchange.  I don't know I've just always been for the clean break.  Never I can never understand the people that break up and then they're friends again.  You know they will just remain friends.  Oh yeah great friends.  Yeah I always remember fondly having sex with my friends. 
[18:00]
 You know because you never get that out of your head.  Not at all.  You know she brings her new boyfriend over and it's like what are you still pals and  you're looking at him and he's looking at you like yeah you know he's a dog.  Yeah it's just awkward.  I like having nothing to do with them.  You look at her new boyfriend and you just give him that look like yeah how do I taste.  Oh my god.  Guys are brutal though.  What.  Oh jeez. 
[18:30]
 But guys are brutal that way.  I understand.  All right clean break.  You know Anthony I just got to tease something here.  My aggregate some stiff competition.  I love that headline right off the bat.  Yeah.  That's cute.  Where did this come from the post.  Yeah.  Must be right.  Pfizer meet big brother a Chinese drug company has unveiled the natural herbal version of  the popular impotent drug Viagra that it touts as safer healthier and cheaper than the famed 
[19:00]
 that love drug.  Wow look at that.  And they call it a wage.  Wage or something like that wage.  It's a Chinese company that came up with Viagra substitute.  That's all the info you got on it.  Yeah we're going to have to.  I wish there was somebody we can do.  We all know.  Do we know any Chinese people that we could call and get some more.  Yes.  Well yeah well maybe we could maybe this one Chinese guy we know.  Maybe we can try that.  Yeah he's been on a show a few times. 
[19:30]
 Maybe he knows something about Viagra.  I'm not busy on his bike.  Yeah well stick around.  We'll try to call him and see what he says about this new Viagra drug.  OK.  Yeah.  All right.  But right now it's time once again for Opie Anthony trivia.  What are we giving away Opie.  Well all week long we get these four pack of tickets to Lowes Theater movie passes obviously.  Yes.  And we want to give it to the people that listen to our show.  Yeah.  Not the people that have been there for a while.  Yeah not the stragglers that come in every once in a while and go out.  You know loyal listeners.  Yeah we want to take care of the faithful listeners. 
[20:00]

All right.  What are we doing this hour.  The L.A. Zoo story I guess.  Yeah I want you to set that up.  Well there's a you remember a monkey in a zoo in Los Angeles got pregnant and they couldn't  find the father because all the male monkeys had vasectomies. 
[20:30]
 Yes.  So we found out who the father was.  Yeah we were trying to figure it out.  We were discussing it and out of nowhere we got the answer to who knocked up the chimpanzee  in the L.A. Zoo.  If you know the answer we'll give you the movie passes.  Okay.  All right.  Hi Eddie W.  Hey how's it going.  Just calling for the trivia.  Yes.  What's your answer?  What's your answer?

Rick's going to take some info from you and congratulations.  All right.  Thanks a lot guys.  We're going to have to delve back a little earlier in our N.E.W. career I think for the  next question Opie.  Well yeah we're just people found out a little easy. 
[21:30]
 But we're just starting this new concept that we figured we'd make it easy at first and  then you know.  Okay.  We'll make people put on their thinking caps later on today.  Yes.  But in case you missed it we got to play it one last time right?  Could be bit of the week.  Yes the LA Zoo it was Yoshi the Chimp believe it or not.  Yoshi the Chimp got pregnant and they couldn't figure out how she got pregnant.  Right we did.  And all of a sudden the door gets knocked down a chariot appears and lo and behold the  Rock in New York one oh two seven W.A.W. with Lenny Kravitz his latest fly away. 
[22:00]
 It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey man.  On the way we got the Dave Matthews band and some Rush for you.  But right now we got to talk about this trainees Viagra real fast.  It's amazing of course everyone knows about Viagra the impotence drug.  And there were a couple of side effects like people seeing blue lights and having heart  attacks and so a lot of variations are coming out and one is coming from China.  Yeah well the story goes here it says Viagra gets some stiff competition.  Pfizer meets Big Brother a Chinese drug company has unveiled a natural herbal version of the 
[22:30]
 popular impotence drug Viagra that it touts as safer healthier and cheaper than the fame  love drug Anthony.  How about that?  They are predicting we are going to sell a hundred million pills this year said Chuang  Wah.  A hundred million?  A hundred million pills this year alone.  How many people are in China?  A billion?

Wow there you go.  Look at that.  A statue of Adonis and flying doves on the package of their Chinese Viagra.  Says Chuang Wah.  Now we need to find out a little more info on this Chinese version of Viagra.

 I flew back onto a sidewalk. I see. And your bike didn't get damaged? No, that happens every day.  Oh, all right. Very, very dangerous. Well, Yoshi, we got to talk about Priceline.com. Hey!

 Well, everyone's got a website now, huh? So the Reverend Al's got one. That's cool. It says,  fans and foes of the Reverend Al Sharpton will soon be able to chat with the outspoken black  activist minister 24 hours a day. Later this month, Sharpton and his Harlem-based National  Action Network will have a new address, www.fyd.com in cyberspace. Stop that! What?  Oh, come on. What? That can't be the address. Oh, I was going to think the story's a joke.

 wonderful website that I have. Well, tell us a little bit about it. Well, if the cops shoot  up your house, tell Reverend Al with a click of the mouse.

[36:30]
 the hallway right now. Sounds like fun. I want to play Tawana Raiders 3. You think we could get some  cheat codes for that? Yeah. I wonder how many hits he's going to get on his website. A million. Oh,  my God. The Rock of New York, 1027W, N.A.W. Van Halen from Van Halen 2. Somebody get me a doctor.  It's Ophie and Anthony, FU Friday. Moving right along. We got one from Rob, Joe and Jen here. 
[37:00]
 Big FU to our big fat furry friend, our boss Dave for going to Cancun for the next week. Oh,  by the way, you forgot to pay us a hole. Screw him. It's 4.45. Well, that's when they sent the  fax and we're slamming back the coronas pretending we're in Mexico. Hey, Dan, FU2. I'll keep up the  good work. We all listen to you here at Perennial. There you go. All right. Thank you very much.  Everyone's still talking about Tara, the lovely Tara who's on our website. If you go to  wnew.com and click on air personalities and then click on Ophie and Anthony and you'll find the 
[37:30]
 pictures from there. Every third instant message that's coming in is about her pictures. Yeah,  but the jury's in at this point. Yeah, we know we read Rick counted them 628 emails before we  went on the air. That was just that came in, you know, overnight. Yeah. And what's that right?  Line two we got to run. Okay. Let's get Tara on the line here. Tara. Yeah. How are you? I'm all 
[38:00]
 right. What's wrong? Nothing. Oh, that doesn't sound good. That doesn't sound good. Yeah,  there's nothing nothing wrong with me. You're taking a lot of heat, huh? No, that's okay. I'm  all right with that. I have no problem. But if we're going to do a challenge. I'll get to that  point. Okay, go ahead. First, the good news. What? You gave us more email than anything else we've  done on our show since coming to NW. You're welcome. We probably got well over a thousand, 
[38:30]
 yeah, a thousand emails since you left. That's a lot. We don't get anywhere near that on a  regular basis. That's good, I guess. People think you're beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.  That I know that I hear. I got most of that. Yeah. And they think you can be a model, but  hands down, people say no way to playboy. Okay. And I heard that there's a girl calling and saying 
[39:00]
 that they could do playboy. Is that what they're saying? Well, no, what we have decided to do is  we're going to put the challenge out there because yeah, there are a lot of girls saying,  man, I have a better body than Tara. Okay. Well, natural. Well, that's what we're doing.  Those are the rules. This is the rules. Simple as this. And we're supposed to get a girl down  here today, but I don't know if she's going to make it. The first challenge for Tara, we are going  to keep your pictures up on our website until someone beats you. Okay. And the rules are simple. 
[39:30]
 You have to come down here if you think you could beat Tara's body. You've got to be able to pose  naked. They have to be able to pose what? At least topless, yes. And undies. Yes, at least.  At least if they want to go the full distance, that's fine. That's up to them. And they can't  have fake boobs. Okay. They have to be natural. Okay. And we'll see how it goes. Then we'll put  their picture up on the website with yours. Wait a minute. Do I get to do like another shot? Well, 
[40:00]
 if the votes come in and you are defeated, you will get to come back and try to regain your crown by  doing repose and retake. Sure. Okay. Yeah. So it's going to be just her in the studio when she's  posing? Right. Yes. Same conditions you got. Okay. Nothing extra. I suppose this girl was coming down  today, but I don't know if she made it. But there's a bunch of other girls that want to challenge you  as well. Well, we put the challenge out there right now. Any girls that want to do this, give 
[40:30]
 us a call and come down and we'll do this. Now what do they got to do? Do they get to do the same  poses or what? Pretty much it's up to Anthony and I. Okay. All right. That's cool. There will be no  unfair advantages in posing or anything. Yeah. I think Anthony did a good job with your shots.  Yeah. Foreign amateur and stuff. Those pictures do me no justice. Of course not. Well, that's what I  think anyway. You don't have to toot my horn, but I think they do me any justice. Man, Tara, 
[41:00]
 you're cracking here on us. Cracking? I can feel it. Why would I crack? Trust me. Most of the people,  and I mean most, like well over 90 percent really think you're hot. But they just say no to Playboy.  That's it. You know what it is? I think a lot of people are also losing faith that it wasn't just  Playboy. It was modeling also. Right. Everyone got hung up on the Playboy thing. Yeah. Everybody got  hung up on the Playboy, which was fine because I flashed my chat. But at the same time, I definitely  think I could. It's so funny because I was looking through Playboy last night and I really want to 
[41:30]
 bring in the, I want to bring in this Playboy that I have. Either they got their hand above their  head or they're holding something up or they got their boobs squished together or they're doing  something to keep them propped up. All right. We didn't do any of that. So if we're going to play,  we'll play right and we'll do it the right way. I have no problem with that. You have no problem  with that? But you know, you've had, I don't know, tens of thousands of people checking out your  pictures already. So in a way we made you famous. Well, that's cool. I mean, I really appreciate 
[42:00]
 that, guys. That's really cool. I mean, like I said, it was all fun and games and that's cool.  All right. But like I said, it'll be a challenge and that'll be cool too because, you know, I mean,  it'll be fun. It'll be really fun. But at the same time, if we're going to do it this time.  All right. All right. We hear you. I'm going to come prepared.  We hear you. Okay. If you get defeated, you can definitely come back and do it as you say the  right way. What's the girl's name, Mom? What's the girl's name coming out today? Do you know?  We don't know. We don't know. We don't even know if she's going to make it today.  She called Rick earlier. There's a bunch of other girls that want in on this, but basically we're 
[42:30]
 going to set up that whole section of the website and make it nice. And you are the reigning champion  right now. Okay. Pretty much the title be like hottest woman that opium Anthony got naked in  their studio. There you go. All right. That sounds cool. And your pictures will stay up there until  someone defeats you. Okay. And if you are defeated, because I'm not sure if that's going to be an easy  task, then you can come back and try to reclaim your title. That sounds cool. All right. All right, 
[43:00]
 guys. You need to call me. We got your number. All right, guys. Don't be so defensive though.  I mean, high marks, extreme high marks in general. A couple low marks from the Russian judges,  but that's okay. No, that's okay, guys. You guys are great. I had a really good time and I just,  I'm glad I got to come in and do it. I'll defend my belt. No problem. All right. There's a tire we  know. Yeah. All right. Keep the confidence up. All right. All right. Bye. Bye. There you go. All  right. So guys, you don't have to, you know, tell us about Tara anymore. Yeah. We got the point. We 
[43:30]
 had so many emails and faxes and phone calls. My voicemail is filled with people commenting.  The challenge is on though. Yeah. We want to move on now. We want to see if there's a girl out there  that can beat Tara. In our listeners eyes. Yes. That's how we do this. It's not us that's making  the decision. You guys leave it to you. Got fake boobs. Don't want anything to do with you.  All natural. We were going for the all natural. Right. Okay. All right. All right. And other 
[44:00]
 show news really fast. It looks like we are going to be broadcasting live next Friday on Long Island.  Yeah. We're getting the details together, but it's going to be really cool. We'll talk. We'll start  really talking about it Monday. On Monday? With all the details. Yeah. I'm going to, I think  this is a definite. We got a couple of trips to give away to Miami. Oh, well, when we go out there,  we do it upright. All right. This is going to be a lot of fun. I'm so glad we're getting out. 
[44:30]
 Really. Well, we begged, you know, the management of any W to send us out there.  And at first they go, trust me guys, you don't want to be out there. They don't really like you  that much yet. Oh gee, thanks. No one in radio is doing sick parties anymore where they just go out,  go to a club and have fun, you know? Well, they're too busy going around in their limos.  It's not happening anymore. You know, last I remember it was like years ago. You got to dip  back to the stern thing when he used to do those club bene things. Those were fun. Yeah. It's like  a freak show and just having a good time. But no one does it anymore. No. So we're going to 
[45:00]
 start to let's go. Let's have fun. Screw it. Yeah. Follow our lead.  One oh two seven W any W the rock of New York creed. That's a song they did on letterman the  other night from their debut CD, my own prison. That's one. It's opiate Anthony and wow, instant  feedback going crazy. Absolutely. The challenge has been put out there. Man,  Tara's pictures are up. Just can't get off of this. But we've, we've added to this. There's  a new challenge out there. It's a lot of ladies have called up and seen Tara's pictures. Of course 
[45:30]
 she came in disrobed. Uh, let us take pictures, put them on the website and a lot of girls are  saying they could beat her, that their body is better. Natural body, natural. We're looking,  no fake boobs. Well, Harry from Valley stream from the conversation on the radio, I expected  much more from Tara's pictures. I've seen much better natural, uh, teetskies than that. She will  easily get defeated. And then he says, uh, don't get me wrong. I wouldn't kick her out of bed. 
[46:00]
 You truly are pigs. Aren't we? Well, there's a bunch of guys, you know, they say, well, now that  I've, uh, taken a second look and yeah, yeah, I spent a second day with the pictures. Yeah.  That's what Luke is saying from Long Island. After looking at her for a second day, she's not all  that living on the beach. I see better every day. Plus she's defensive, which is not that attractive.  Luke, he has to keep up the good work. Uh, yeah, look, he sat with the pictures now. Now he looks 
[46:30]
 for a second day and it's like, you know, the, the whole excitement of the new girl on the web isn't  with people anymore. Isn't that the truth though? Look at this. You meet that, that dream girl and  like, wow, she's perfect. Man, look at her. And you go out with her for a few weeks and you know,  you start picking her farm stuff. Look at this. Their little online relationship with their photos  are already taking a turn. Yes. Isn't that amazing? And Tara, if she's still listening,  we are counting how many guys that have told us they, they, uh, want, want to your pictures. 
[47:00]
 And it's the numbers are getting high. Oh, yeah. Don't, don't even worry about, I mean, look,  this guy, Tara is lovely. Look at that. All right. But the challenges out there and people  are already getting excited for the challenge. Yes. Um, if you're a fine young lady and you're  up for the challenge to come in here and disrobe and get some pictures taken, we'll put your  pictures side by side with Tara and then we'll have the listeners vote. And, uh, and there you  go. But Tara's pictures will remain on that site until, uh, someone defeats her. Bob Long Island. 
[47:30]
 Tell that chick Tara to get her breasts fixed. They look like two bananas chasing her armpits,  but I wouldn't kick her out of bed for spilling crumbs. Dig your show. Where's the Friday fake?  Oh, yeah. Where is the Friday fake? Oh, yeah. We had that last week and, uh,  God, we got to do that this week. It was such a hit last week. Yeah. Uh, we still have an hour.  Yeah. We need a lady to, uh, do the Friday fake orgasm for us. A lot of people look forward to 
[48:00]
 this feature. We finally brought it out of retirement last week. She was a wookie. Yes.  That's right. Oh, P lost his virginity to a girl that had a mane. She had hair down her back.  Thank you. Look at the hair on her back.  Yes. I too thought she was dating Chewbacca. 
[48:30]
 I don't know. Maybe it's easier for him to hold on to. All right.  With me. Listen, listen with me. She was really hot though. Hot. She had a nice face and stuff.  She had the big black nose and the teeth. Chewy inset eyes. Well, yeah, the story goes she had 
[49:00]
 like a, a mane. Did it like a thick strip of hair that went from the top of her neck all the way  down to her, uh, all the way down to her tailbone, all the way down to her hoop.  Oh, her what? All the way down to her balloon. Not  all the way down to the whale's eye. 
[49:30]
 Is anyone listening to this? I hope not. Okay. Balloon. Not that's cute.  That's disgusting. What's your name? Marlene.  And where are you calling from Marlene? Belmore.  Are you horrified by our conversation? No, no.  I am. My kids are loving it. Oh good. You want to send out an FU to anyone?  Yes. I want to send out a big FU to the guy who totaled my husband's car last week.  What happened? Ouch.  I was parked in front of the house and this guy was drunk or on something and he came around the 
[50:00]
 corner and smashed it. My husband only had the car for two weeks. Oh, that was you? I apologize.  A big FU to Brian. I won't say his last name. I'll say his last name. What the heck?  Brian? No. All right. All right. That's fine. I think he's in rehab now. I feel sorry for him.  All right. At least he's getting the help he needs. That's right. Something Anthony and I  should look into. All right. Well, hold on a while. We're going to get some info from you.  Okay. Thank you. All right. Cool.  Nip, nip, nip, nip, nip, nip. 
[50:30]
 You railroaded me today, man. I love you. Don't leave me because my back is hairy. Nip, nip.  Why did I even flip her over? Because I want to get a little lie. That must have been great if  she had hair all the way down her spine. I take it. You know, maybe she was a little, 
[51:00]
 I don't remember. I don't remember. I really don't remember. I don't remember if it looked  like she had maybe Albert Einstein's head in a leg. I was thinking more Jerry Garcia, but no,  I don't remember that. Link from the Mod Squad. What? Earl's got a girl. Get black girl in here.  Earl's got a girl. Yeah. What does he mean by that? Well, because we've never seen.  Earl, come in here. Come here. Earl, who's the fine? What's up? She wants to. Hey, how you doing? 
[51:30]
 Look at this. Wow. All right. Are you related to her or no, in no way? Are you a friend of Earl?  I am somewhat a friend of Earl's. Yes. Would you meet a club somewhere? No, Black Rock Coalition.  Remember what? The Black Rock Coalition. Really? Is there a Black Rock Coalition? What is this?  Enlighten Us. It's an organization, you know, in kind of in support of musicians who play music 
[52:00]
 that they're not expected to play. Oh, like interesting. Like Vernon Reid. He's one of the  founders. I know him. The founding member. How about that? I know my black culture. If I want  to get Black History Month, if I want to get some, you know, black, I got to know some stuff. Look,  Opie is really hot on getting a black girl. It's one of his fantasies. And just look at him now.  He can't go to any clubs or anything. He's the whitest guy. I've tried, though. But I see that  there are sisters who, you know, would be willing to. I celebrated Kwanzaa just so I'm up on it. 
[52:30]
 Really? Well, not really. He's just saying that. I didn't celebrate it either. But I knew Vernon Reid  was the head of that. Yes. All right. Who else is? There's not many black rock guys anymore.  I can't hear any of the top of my.  Oh, what are you talking about?  Earl's just in it for the chicks. Come on.  Another of the founders is Greg Tate, who writes for the Village Voice and has  thousands of bands. What about old Dirty Bastard?  No. He will not be admitted.

Yes, she called.  Yes.  And you know why she called?  No, I couldn't figure that out. I thought she was calling to  tell you she was going to happy hour.

Yo, you sent over my teddy bear.  Before you know it, you don't want to get over that ass.  So now, if you want to get over that ass,  get over my teddy bear.

 hi, bear counselor.  Yes.  Hi, my girl. She's like a hosebag.  She loves sex all the time.  He'd recommend the horny little devil bear.  Exactly.  Which you can get. It's a cute little bear.  It's got the devil's horns and a tail.  Mm-hmm.  The horny little devil.  And they just got so many to choose from.  Mm-hmm.  It's ridiculous.  If you're online right now, you can go to their website  and they got more.  www.vermonteddybear.com  or give them a call.  1-800-829-BEAR.  That's 1-800-829-BEAR. 
[56:30]
 And if you're doing this, they do the bear grams.  Yeah.  Try to write, you're a dirty little girl.  You're a dirty girl, aren't you?  Yeah.  I would love to see how many people put that on their card this year.  That'd be pretty fun.  You can get some.  Let me get in that ass.  Damn.  All right.  Well, I guess we got to rock.  For these multipurpose applications,  how can anyone be offended when you use the word?  We say, use this unique flexible word more often than your daily speech. 
[57:00]
 It will identify the quality of your character immediately.  Say it loudly and proudly.  You know, I've heard that a hundred times easily  and it makes me laugh every time like I'm hearing it for the first time.  The hide and go eff yourself line.  Why don't you go outside and play hide and go eff yourself?  You gotta love it. 
[57:30]
 Well, that's for everyone that is stuck in traffic using that word right now.  Sophie and Anthony, you're listening to any W.  Here it is, Mike Tyson, back behind bars.  Now, this is real?  Yeah, this is real.  He's in jail.  Well, yeah, boxer Mike Tyson has been sentenced to jail time  for assaulting two motorists after a minor traffic accident  in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C.  Judge Steven Johnson sentenced him to two years in jail, but suspended one year. 
[58:00]
 He's also been fined $5,000 and will be on two years probation after being released from jail.  The ruling could affect Tyson's future in the ring.  Indiana authorities will now have to decide if this constitutes  a violation of his probation on a 1991 rape conviction.  Of course, that's a violation.  Yeah, yeah, assault.  The sentence could also lead to a review of Tyson's boxing license,  which was recently restored in Nevada after a year of suspension.  The guy's screwed.  But it's dope.  Hey, good afternoon, everybody. 
[58:30]
 Hi.  Mike and the Bad Dog.  Yeah, hi.  Obviously, Mike Tyson back in trouble again.  Yes, he's in trouble.  Lots of trouble.  Well, you got to look at it this way.  He's a very marvelous personality.  Right.  So obviously, he couldn't stay out of trouble for very long.  Well, you got to give the judge a lot of credit on this one.  Well, of course, you got to give the judge a lot of credit.  Of course, you got a guy out there just going crazy.  Assaulting people for a basic traffic violation. 
[59:00]
 So this guy is back in jail another year.  He's going to get back out probably good as time served  and be back in the ring again.  Hopefully, very soon.  It's going to be amazing.  Now, Mad Dog, do you think this is terrible?  This is terrible.  On this Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Let's take some calls.  All right, Mad Dog.  Oh, you're on here.  Yeah, this is Mike and Mad Dog. 
[59:30]
 Yes.  I love your show.  Long time, listen to First Time Caller.  Boy, how about this Tyson thing?  You know, you got to follow the personality.  Obviously, he's in trouble dealing with his society.  So he's back in jail.  All right, thank you.  We're going to be discussing the Tyson thing for 18 hours straight.  So stay with us with a friend.  Mike and Mad Dog.  They'll discuss every single angle.  They'll discuss what would happen if Mike Tyson were on the moon 
[60:00]
 and an alien ship hit his ship and he got to fight with ET.  I think the ET would be able to beat Tyson.  Well, I don't know about that.  What do you think, Mikey?  Do you think an ET could beat Tyson with those teeth and be biting off ears?  No, I don't think so, dog.  Well, I have to agree with you there.  That would be a terrible thing.  But I would think Tyson would beat up the alien.  Thank you for the call.  What would happen if Tyson were to transport his body to another dimension? 
[60:30]
 Well, that's a very fascinating question.  I believe he would be in trouble in any dimension he was in.  I think you got to give the caller a lot of credit for that question.  Well, the caller gets a lot of credit.  Okay.  For that question, coming up with an optional dimension question on this Friday.  I love that, man. 
[61:00]
 Radio guy that can't talk.  You know, they're probably relieved that the Tyson story broke  because they were up to hour 20 of talking about the NBA season starting this weekend.  And what Patrick Ewing is going to be doing on the call.  You know what?  Watch him and see.  That's a good way to find out.  I just hope Patrick decides to pass the ball this year.  Don't worry about your points, Patrick.  Well, if Patrick Ewing was maybe a submarine commander,  how would that play out in the NBA? 
[61:30]
 Let's go with hour 25 on that one.  And someone's on top of it.  A big F you to Chris Russo from the fans, Tim McCarver,  and all the dirtbag Yankee fans that called in to complain on the fan.  All from the Bronx.  Obviously, I'm talking about Tom Siver coming in in place of Tim McCarver.  I think I'm not a good move for the metal.  I know they're saying that's a stupid,  but I'm a funny, stupid move.  That's obvious. 
[62:00]
 And I need to do when you do.  I mean, I mean, all right, very good.  So you could man dog leave.  It's really annoying.  I don't know.  I can add on.  I've been in the end.  They didn't say that.  And I'm fine.  Could you just leave?  No, really.  It was it was funny, like for two minutes, but now it's really annoying.  That was funny for like 30 seconds.  All right.  We could let like mad dogs say a special goodbye.  How's that?  I like to say goodbye and it's funny. 
[62:30]
 One oh two seven W.N.E.W.  The Rock of New York.  You're right.  Collective soul run from dosage.  All right.  It's open Anthony.  Thanks.  Hey, we got to give away another four pack of tickets to Lowe's Theater movie passes. 
[63:00]
 And we need another open Anthony trivia question because we want to give all our prizes from now  on to our faithful listeners.  OK, so we figure if we give open Anthony questions, give me a beer, Ben.  Yeah, one one.  All right, a little.  I'm not drinking out of the same bottle as you, though.  All right.  Come on, give me a beer.  I'm surprised to see you drinking out of a bottle, Ben.  I just heard you like it in the can.  And the fact everyone I'm on the website, I'm so excited. 
[63:30]
 Everybody knows what it looks like.  So I get lynched now in public.  You're just getting creamed on the website.  I'm taking pictures of Tara and on the website, if you look down at one of the pictures, you  see Ben the fag standing behind Tara.  But he's he's looking at me taking the picture and not looking at Tara.  One guy said it looks like Ben the fag.  One guy instant feedback.  He said it looks like this is the first time Ben the fag has ever seen a girl about to  take her clothes off. 
[64:00]
 All right, we'll stress again.  Ben the fag needs a funeral.  I'm telling you, it's getting out tonight.  I'm going to Ozzie with Earl.  Earl and I are going to go out to Ozzie at the Continental Arena soon.  I'm going to get lynched.  We're sitting in front of Dave Matthews the other night.  This guy looks at the van.  A black guy sitting in the N.E.W. van looks, sees me, he goes, you guys, that's black girl  in Ben the fag.  He's like, holy cow, I always wanted to meet you guys.  I was getting out of control.  Hey, you know, you got to take your celebrity and work it. 
[64:30]
 You know, deal with it.  Hey, Ben, that's really cute that you're having a few beers before you drive the company.  I'm not driving.  I'm not driving.  Earl's driving.  And where's Earl?  Oh, he's booting up in the lobby.  I expect a black guy to boot up.  Oh, I thought we were just having fun.  Check, please.  Waiter.  Check, please.  That was a joke.  Some joke.  Earl's driving tonight.  I'm going to be in Long Island scouting for the party next week today.  And yeah, that's going to be great when we broadcast live next Friday. 
[65:00]
 But no, Ben.  So you want us to bury Ben the fag?  See, Ben isn't gay.  He's not gay.  Supposedly he's not gay.  Come on.  We have no documented evidence.  Well, Earl says he's not gay.  I know.  Ben's always talking about these girls that he goes out with.  And we always hear him come up with these stories of his sexual exploits.  And it just sounds so great.  But we never see him with a girl.  The only story we've heard of really that have been confirmed by phone calls from friends 
[65:30]
 has been the story when he left the bar with transvestites.  No, no, no.  Sexuals.  And what about the...  Oh wow, big difference.  He sent her his daughter too.  I don't know.  I didn't hear any.  He did get a hummer from a senator's daughter.  So yeah.  All right.  That's what he said.  Black girl is in the studio.  Hey, black girl, what's up?  Hey, David.  Are you booting up?  Booting up.  Damn, you both.  Are you looking forward to Black Sabbath tonight?  Oh.  Victor, yes, I am.  If you just said that with a Southern accent, L.P., it would just sound even better. 
[66:00]
 What are you talking about?  Hey, Earl, are you looking forward to Black Sabbath?  You get that one there, boy.  All right.  Opie, you're sounding a bit racist here on the show today.  I know.  I apologize.  I'm not, though.  What time is it?  Yeah, it is your hour.  I'm not, but...  It's your hour to sound racist.  It was mine last, the five o'clock hour.  I love when people talk about racism and they do, but...  I'm not a racist, but...  But...  But, there's always that but.  Yeah, I know.  It's horrible. 
[66:30]
 All right.  I've given up.  We're just talking on this show.  If it comes out and people interpret it as either racist or sexist or homophobic...  Well, you're getting a lot of trouble.  Whatever.  And you got in this huge fight with this Asian guy over Yoshi.  Yoshi.  This guy's screaming and yelling.  That guy called up.  He's like, I was offended by Yoshi's skit.  I was like, oh, you must be an Asian man.  Why?  Because of my voice?  I'm like, well, yeah. 
[67:00]
 And he was very offended.  And then he got mad.  He said Yoshi's not even a Chinese name.  Well, we know that.  That's what makes the bit really funny.  He hung up after he got so annoyed.  I told him I was going to pound creamed rice up his butt.  And he started laughing.  And I go, look, you're laughing.  And he hung up because he got so annoyed with himself that he was laughing at it.  But then he called the boss.  Yeah.  Now the boss has to deal with that one.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Join the club.  Stand in line.  You guys have fun at Black Sabbath.  The comedy team of Black Girl and Ben the Fag. 
[67:30]
 On the road again tonight.  Those fans are going to love me.  But remember, Ben the Fag is not a fag.  Right.  We'll come up with another name for you soon.  OK.  I'm sorry.  He's straight.  He's a fag.  He's straight.  He's a fag.  All right.  We got to give away these movie passes to Lowe's Theater.  Four of them.  We need an open Anthony trivia question.  And we didn't think of any while the music was playing.  Oh, you want to dip back into the show?  Yeah, you could do that. 
[68:00]
 OK.  Gee, I guess I got to pick on me since I picked on you with the last one.  Something out of my youth, my school days.  What used to get me excited?  Oh, very good.  Back in my youth.  I don't think the first person's going to get this one.  We're three for three.  First person getting it.  What got Anthony excited when he was a youth?  Kind of out of the ordinary.  It is very out of the ordinary.  I don't know why, but it just happened. 
[68:30]
 Hi, N.E.W.  Hi.  What used to get you excited?  Yeah.  No, what got Anthony excited when he was young?  What got Anthony excited when he was young?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  I'm getting stoned.  Yeah, you got to dip back for this one.  How about a hint?  No, no hints.  Because I know there's people out there that know it.  Sorry, man.  You must be one of the guys that said,  hey, man, I just started listening to you guys two weeks ago.  You know what? 
[69:00]
 I can't believe you said that because I'm so pissed  that I wanted to get in and win these goddamn tickets.  I looked at you guys for months and you can't believe it was one question.  I can't answer.  I swear to God, man.  Yeah, but we got to move on to someone else.  I'm sorry.  We got chances to win all weekend long.  All right.  As long as you don't think I'm one of those fags that just...  No, no, no.  Not at all, man.  We can tell by your attitude.  Say hi to someone.  What do you want to say hi to real fast?  What do I want to say hi to?  Yeah, that'll be a little consolation prize. 
[69:30]
 I guess I'll say what's up to my boys,  Patty and Danny.  They're on a bachelor party right now in AC.  Are they your flip-mo squad?  Uh, yeah.  In AC?  Right now, they're probably banging prostitutes.  At least you're honest.  That's a nice weekend.  I just want them using bags, that's all.  All right, man.  Have a great weekend.  I love the honesty on this show.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hi. 
[70:00]
 Uh, doing a trivia question?  Yeah.  What used to get Anthony excited as a youth?  Marshall Brady.  Well, that's one thing, but it wasn't the...  It wasn't the thing.  That wasn't the thing?  No, no.  This is something out of the ordinary.  Okay.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thanks, man.  Thank you.  That's like...  That's kind of...  That's like half right.  It's half right, but it's something out of the ordinary.  Okay.  Hi, N.E.W.  I know the answer to the trivia question.  You do?  What used to get Anthony excited as a youth?  Older women.  No, that was Opie. 
[70:30]
 Oh, my bad.  All right, man.  Wow, this is a tough one.  Someone's got to get it.  Hi, N.E.W.  It's not Gilligan.  Gilligan's Island is it?  No, no, no, no, no.  Something out of the ordinary.  I don't know, dude, man.  All right, from my youth.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hello.  Hey.  What used to get Anthony excited?  Something out of the ordinary.  Looking up girls' dresses?  That's one of them too. 
[71:00]
 Yeah, you guys are hitting on every single one of them.  That's not out of the ordinary.  Except for the one.  This is one thing that I used to get physically excited,  not emotionally excited.  Boners over.  Yeah, it would just happen.  Hi, N.E.W.  I'm nowhere.  You got an answer.  Yeah, you're on.  Turn down your radio.  We're on delay.  Oh, I'm so sorry.  Okay, a yellow school bus.  There you go.  Yeah, baby.  There it is.  For some reason, I used to sport wood on my way to Elwood Junior High 
[71:30]
 on the big yellow school bus.  I would get on the bus, sit down, and for some reason, I would sport wood.  And then when I got to school, I'd get to Elwood Junior High,  I'd get off the bus, I'd have to put my books in front of me as I walked  to cover the sported wood.  Don't ask me why.  Don't ask me how.  It doesn't happen anymore.  You're a dirty bus, aren't you? 
[72:00]
 Yeah.  Look at that big puff of diesel fumes coming out of your tailpipe.  And you're a poop.  Yeah.  Oh, you're such a dirty yellow bus.  All right, man.  Hold on a while.  I'm going to give you the tickets.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  All right, you won.  What's your name, man?  AJ.  And where are you calling from?  Westchester.  All right, congratulations.  Thanks.  And thanks for listening.  Please hold.  One five.  I don't know why it used to happen, but it did, Opie.  All right, we got one more thing to do before we get out of here,  and that is the Friday fake. 
[72:30]
 Now we had some problems getting a Friday fake.  Oh, this week.  Well, we're still we're still going through the phone lines.  We're trying to get a female to do this for us.  And so far, no one has passed the audition.  No, some of the girls don't get it.  They get on, they go, oh, Friday, they go, oh, oh, oh, that's not it.  So you got to work it like an actress.  So we'll either have a brand new one next time we talk,  or we'll just have to play Stacey again from last week to show people what it's like.  The Rock of New York, one oh two seven W.N.E.W. 
[73:00]
 We'll send that out to Tara, the star of the show this week.  Yeah, without a doubt, her picture is still on the W.N.E.W. website.  And there you have it.  We just put up some brand new tech.  So you might want to go back there and check it out  because we are looking for other women to join the competition  to see if they got what it takes to dethrone Tara as the hottest girl to ever strip on  the Open Anthony show.  Yeah, because we have a lot of girls calling up saying, hey, she's nothing.  Right. 
[73:30]
 No, I could beat her.  So we're giving you the shot.  Come on down.  We'll take some pics, put them up on the website,  let the listeners decide who is the queen.  That's right.  Yes.  But Tara's pictures will remain there until someone dethrones her.  Mm hmm.  We got Stephen Lynch on the hotline.  Oh, Stephen.  Stephen.  Yeah.  So Anthony.  What's up, fella?  How you doing, Steve?  All right.  This competition is the most ingenious thing I've ever heard.  It's smart.  I want to be there so badly. 
[74:00]
 Isn't it so self-serving?  It makes me want to get my own radio show.  Yeah.  Well, our show is your show.  You come by whenever you want.  And we somehow I think if you did it.  Let me know when the Puski is going to be there.  Yeah.  I think if you did it, somehow guys would show up.  I don't know.  Or who am I?  I would have to redeem myself next time I come on.  Yeah.  So how did it go last night? 
[74:30]
 Oh, last night was great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I want to thank you guys for plugging the show.  There's a lot of Opie and Anthony fans down there.  Wow, really?  They made themselves known.  Yeah, it was cool.  We had a good time.  Cool.  Very cool.  Now we got to know if he's going to be able to hook up with us next Friday.  Oh yeah, definitely.  Oh really?  Yeah, for sure.  You're going to definitely do a few songs and stuff?  Yeah.  There you go guys.  I'm going to sing some non-gay songs.  Yeah, you do.  What are you going to write some? 
[75:00]
 I'm going to dust off the ones I've been keeping under my pillow for 10 years.  Just such an emergency.  I don't know.  I think the people want to hear the gay songs.  They want to hear the gerbil song.  I give the people what they want to hear.  Of course.  If it's gay, it's gay.  You know, there's nothing I can do about it.  You got to.  You got to.  Yeah, so we're going to broadcast our show live next Friday.  We'll have all the details starting next week.  And Stephen Lynch is on board.  He's going to be there performing live.  This is going to be a party.  So bring in the Pusky. 
[75:30]
 We'll have lots of Pusky for you, Steveskin.  And maybe some pex-kiss.  Whatever you please.  I also hear a rumor that you're working on a Tuesday Night Hummer song.  Yeah, I don't want to divulge too much.  All right, there's rumors floating around that you might have something to donate.  I heard somebody mention that on the air the other day.  So I thought I'd get to work.  You better get to work. 
[76:00]
 Got it.  I heard Stephen's going to be parachuting onto the top of the NAW building.  You know, here's the problem though.  Is that I'm not officially a member of the club.  I think we could take care of that for you.  That's what I'm talking about.  You know what I mean?  Well, not us personally.  That's right.  Not you guys.  Well, we understand your taste.  Wait a minute.  I got inducted to the Hummer Club. 
[76:30]
 I think the song is writing itself.  Well, I got 20 bucks and Ann's got 20.  I think we could try your 40 to get into the club.  Yeah.  Well, you know, you really have to pay for it, man.  Yeah, I know.  Isn't that perfect?  Well, it's funny.  One guy did admit to that.  He said he wanted to join the club so badly that he did go out and he spent like 15 bucks.  Are you kidding me?  I swear to God.  Hey, did he lie?  Well, he forgot to mention that on the radio.  There's no lying.  No, there's no lying.  Because, you know, it's in the back of your head. 
[77:00]
 You just know you're not part of the club.  Right.  Stephen, it's just lying to yourself.  You're right.  So we can count on you next Friday.  That's hot.  Yeah, definitely.  This is great.  That'll be fun.  This is shaping up to be a good bash.  Cool.  Is this the one where there's going to be deformed chicks running around and stuff?  Is that something different?  We might be blowing off that for a little while.  I don't know.  We got so many damn things going on now.  We come up with ideas and just throw them out there. 
[77:30]
 But that idea is starting to get legs as well.  We're going to have a freak show, a larger ratio.  I got to tell you, that's one of my favorite ideas.  Wouldn't you love to just see a little fidget girl in a thong and little teddy?  I'm so intrigued by that thought.  Well, them's not babies.  Them's fidgets.  Well, it's going to be the open Anthony lingerie freak show.  Just like the Victoria's Secret lingerie show.  First annual.  We do have Mindy, Big Butt Mindy, that is definitely on board and ready to go. 
[78:00]
 Okay.  She's got an ass like a truck.  Swear to God, it's huge.  Well, Steve, you remember the door you walked through, obviously, in the studio?  She has to walk through that sideways.  So she's on board to put some lingerie on.  Wow.  And then for the ladies, we got a guy who is the hairiest guy in the world.  Like when he shaves, he's got to make a decision where he stops because it's like it's not  whiskers anymore.  It's chest hair.  Ever see those guys? 
[78:30]
 They just got to stop.  And it's like where the forest meets the plains.  All of a sudden it just stops.  Yeah, we got him coming on.  All right.  And he's going to wear a banana hammock.  A little marble bag.  But we're still looking for a midget.  We're going to pay for a crack hoard, put some lingerie on.  That's like 20 bucks.  That's the idea.  Hey, maybe you could do that and I could join the club at the same time. 
[79:00]
 And now on the runway, wearing lace and scabs.  It's the crack whore.  Yeah, we'll have fun with it.  Sure.  Yeah, that'll be great.  I look forward to that.  All right, man.  All right, Stan.  So yeah, once you call in next week or come by or something.  Okay.  If you want, it's up to you.  All right.  We won't make you perform or nothing.  You can just hang.  Make you perform.  Give me a fish.  All right.  All right.  I could do that.  But at the worst, we'll see you next Friday when we broadcast live somewhere on Long 
[79:30]
 Island.  Details to come.  Sounds good.  We have a place all picked out and everything.  We'll give you all the details next week.  Cool.  It's our buddy.  It's our pal, Steven Lynch, everyone.  All right.  All right.  You want to give out your cute little email address real fast or?  Oh, sure.  It's the PusHead, man.  PusHead at AOL.com.  You know, people put that in their server and they think it's a website.  Yeah.  Well, we're working on that.  He got the coveted PusHead name at AOL. 
[80:00]
 A lot of people wanted that.  It is coveted.  Now they got to go to PusHead 101 and PusHead 3, you know, the original PusHead.  Of course.  The original PusHead.  Yeah, with one S, by the way.  That's right.  To clear up any confusion.  I'm not PusKey Head.  Wow, I'm going to change my screen name when I get home.  What?  PusKey?  I want to be PusKey Head.  I'm not PusKey Head.  I'm PusKey.  All right, Steven, we're going to let you go. 
[80:30]
 All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  We'll talk to you soon.  Okay.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  He's our pal.  He's on board.  That's very cool.  I like it.  And thanks for supporting him last night at Caroline's.  Yeah, he's going to be well, never mind.  I won't bust that for him yet.  But things are happening for him.  Line three.  She wants to do a Friday fake.  Oh, hi.  Who's this?  Yeah.  Who is this?  Kirsten.  Hi.  How old are you?  Kirsten.  18.  You sound a little young.  18.  Dude, that's perfect.  All right.  Where are you calling from?  Jersey.  All right.  And now, you know what? 
[81:00]
 We're looking forward with the Friday fake orgasm.  Yeah.  Have you ever faked it before?  Couple of times.  Couple of times what?  The guys just weren't doing it for you?  Yeah.  And you had to make them feel good?  Yeah.  Now, did you do it properly?  Because we like how it starts kind of slow, right?  And it works its way up.  And it slowly builds to a crescendo.  And then tapers off in just this little ecstasy thing.  Yeah.  Gotcha.  Yep.  Okay.  You think you could do it?  I think so.  The guys count on this and some of the ladies count on this as well. 
[81:30]
 Yeah.  Oh.  All right.  Yeah.  Just don't curse.  All right.  Really get in the mindset.  All right.  Okay.  Make like a dirty girl.  All right.  You're right.  We're ready.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  Okay. 
[82:00]
 All right.  Hold on.  We're going to go to the peter meter.  Wow.  Fully aroused.  Very good on the peter meter.  You got high marks for that.  All right.  Thank you very much.  No problem.

 Hey, tell Stephen Lynch if he's still listening.  I'm willing offering right here.  I'll let him in for a hummer cup.  Oh, wow.  Look at that lucky bastard.  All right.  We can make a part of our show.  We'll do it live on our show next Tuesday.  I'll do it.  I'm not being there Friday, so.  No one's Stephen.  He would go for that.  All right.  He plays the tune.  Well, at the worst, you'll see him Friday.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Thanks for helping us out today.  No problem.  All right.  In fact.  She was good.  She was good.

 I like it.  I can put Stacey's away.  Yeah.  All right.  Stacey from last week, which was really hot.  So go down.  We'll put Stacey back into the Friday fake orgasm Hall of Fame.  Over here.  The Orchives.  That's what I like to call them.  Orchives.  All right.  I guess we got to go.  Is that it?  Wow.  Look at the time.  Yeah.  Over again.  I need a song to play, though.  What do you got?  I don't know.  Why don't we play?  Want to play the Clash?  Yeah.  Let's play the Clash.  Yeah, that's good.  Give me the Clash.

 Which one?  The Train in Vain, man.  Cool.  All right.  Thanks for listening, guys.  Appreciate it.  And we got so much going on on the Opie and Anthony show.  So please tune in.  Monday at three.  We got all sorts of weird ideas floating out there.  And some of them will be coming together next week.  And we'll announce where our little bash is going to be for next Friday.

 You're going to want to be a part of that.  So make time with your employer.
